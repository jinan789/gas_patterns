The provided Solidity code was analyzed and the following gas-wasting patterns were identified:

\subsection*{1. Constant Function Hash Calculation}

\subsubsection*{How did you find this pattern?}
In the \texttt{getProxyImplementation} and \texttt{getProxyAdmin} functions, there is a constant hash calculation: \texttt{bytes4(keccak256("implementation()"))} and \texttt{bytes4(keccak256("admin()"))}. These hash values are constant and do not change. However, they are computed each time these functions are called, which results in an unnecessary gas cost.

\subsubsection*{What should I do, step by step, to fix the found gas-wasting patterns?}
You can calculate these hash values once and store them as constants in the contract. This way, the computation is not repeated each time the function is called. Here is how you can do it:
\begin{verbatim}
// Add these lines at the top of your contract.
bytes4 private constant SELECTOR_IMPLEMENTATION = bytes4(keccak256("implementation()"));
bytes4 private constant SELECTOR_ADMIN = bytes4(keccak256("admin()"));

// Then replace the hardcoded values in the function calls like this:
(bool success, bytes memory returndata) = address(proxy).staticcall(SELECTOR_IMPLEMENTATION);
(bool success, bytes memory returndata) = address(proxy).staticcall(SELECTOR_ADMIN);
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection*{Suggestions for improving your prompt.}
Your prompt is detailed and clear. Including both the known gas-wasting patterns and the Solidity code is very helpful. However, it would be good to know any specific requirements or constraints you might have regarding the code. For example, are there any particular performance requirements, or is there a specific gas cost that you're trying to achieve? This information would help in providing more focused and relevant suggestions.

\subsection*{2. Redundant Success Check}

\subsubsection*{How did you find this pattern?}
In both \texttt{getProxyImplementation} and \texttt{getProxyAdmin} functions, a success check is performed using the \texttt{require} statement after the \texttt{staticcall}. However, if the \texttt{staticcall} fails, it will revert the transaction anyway. This makes the \texttt{require} statement redundant and wastes gas.

\subsubsection*{What should I do, step by step, to fix the found gas-wasting patterns?}
You can remove the \texttt{require} statements from the \texttt{getProxyImplementation} and \texttt{getProxyAdmin} functions. The EVM will automatically revert the transaction if the \texttt{staticcall} fails, so the \texttt{require} statement is unnecessary. Here is how you could do it:
\begin{verbatim}
(, bytes memory returndata) = address(proxy).staticcall(SELECTOR_IMPLEMENTATION);
return abi.decode(returndata, (address));

(, bytes memory returndata) = address(proxy).staticcall(SELECTOR_ADMIN);
return abi.decode(returndata, (address));
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection*{Suggestions for improving your prompt.}
Your prompt is quite clear and comprehensive. However, knowing the context or specific use-case of your contract can help provide more tailored advice. For instance, if there are specific data structures or functions you often use in your contracts, providing those could lead to more relevant suggestions.

Please note that these optimizations are very minor and will not save a significant amount of gas. In general, readability, maintainability, and security should not be compromised for minor gas optimizations. Furthermore, these suggestions are based on the code snippet provided and may not be applicable or may need to be adjusted depending on the broader context of your contract's code.
