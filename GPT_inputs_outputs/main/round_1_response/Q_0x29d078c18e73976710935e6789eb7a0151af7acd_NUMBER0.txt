1. **Repeated computation of `\_msgSender()`**
    - **Finding process**: The `\_msgSender()` function, which returns the address of the message sender, is called multiple times within the same function in some cases, like in `transfer` and `approve`. This constitutes a repeated computation.
    - **Fix**: Store the result of `\_msgSender()` in a local variable at the beginning of the function and reuse the variable instead of calling the function again. This could potentially save some gas. Here is how you would do this for the `transfer` function:
        ```solidity
        function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public virtual override returns (bool) {
            address owner = \_msgSender();
            \_transfer(owner, to, amount);
            return true;
        }
        ```
        would become:
        ```solidity
        function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public virtual override returns (bool) {
            address owner = \_msgSender();
            \_transfer(owner, to, amount);
            return true;
        }
        ```
    - **Reasoning**: In Solidity, local memory is cheaper to access than storage and execution. Therefore, storing the value in a local variable and reusing it could save gas.

2. **Repeated computation of `\_allowances[owner][spender]`**
    - **Finding process**: In the `increaseAllowance` and `decreaseAllowance` functions, `\_allowances[owner][spender]` is computed twice. This could be seen as a form of repeated computation.
    - **Fix**: Store the result of `\_allowances[owner][spender]` in a local variable at the start and reuse it. For example, `increaseAllowance` function would look like this:
        ```solidity
        function increaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 addedValue) public virtual returns (bool) {
            address owner = \_msgSender();
            uint256 currentAllowance = \_allowances[owner][spender];
            \_approve(owner, spender, currentAllowance + addedValue);
            return true;
        }
        ```
    - **Reasoning**: Again, accessing local memory is cheaper than repeated computation or storage access. As a result, storing the value in a local variable and reusing it could save gas.

\section*{Improvement Suggestions for the Prompt}

The given task is quite clear and I appreciate the detailed explanation of the gas-wasting patterns. However, in order to improve the task for next time, it might be beneficial to include the following:

1. **Specific Solidity Version**: Different versions of Solidity have different gas costs and optimizations. Specifying the version would help in a more accurate analysis.

2. **Compiler Information**: Knowing the compiler settings, especially the optimization level, would be useful as some issues might be automatically solved by compiler optimizations.

3. **Code Context**: Providing more information about the context in which the code is used would help to identify more potential improvements. For instance, if a function is called more frequently than others, it would be more beneficial to focus on optimizing that function.

Overall, the prompt was well-structured and the task was clear. With the above suggestions, it would be even better next time.
