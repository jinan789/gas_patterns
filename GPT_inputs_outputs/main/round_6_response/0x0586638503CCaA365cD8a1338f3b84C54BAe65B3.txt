After careful analysis of the provided Solidity code, I've identified a few potential gas-wasting patterns. Below, I'll describe the patterns, explain how I found them, provide potential solutions, and rate the implications in terms of readability, security, and maintainability.

\subsection*{1. Redundant Conditional Checks in Transfer Functions}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Discovery Process:} In the `_transferFrom` function, there are redundant checks for whether `sender` and `recipient` are not the zero address. This same check is performed in the `transferFrom` function, which calls `_transferFrom`. Thus, if the transfer originates from `transferFrom`, the same condition is checked twice, wasting gas.
\item \textbf{Solution:} Remove the redundant checks in the `_transferFrom` function. Since `transferFrom` already checks these conditions, there's no need to check them again in `_transferFrom`.
\item \textbf{Implication Score:} Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. This change should have minimal impact on readability, security, and maintainability. It simplifies the code, without sacrificing security since checks are still performed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2. Repeated Computation in tokenSwap Function}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Discovery Process:} In the `tokenSwap` function, the expression `_devBuyTax + _devSellTax` is calculated multiple times. Similarly, the expression `_liquidityBuyTax + _liquiditySellTax` and `_marketingBuyTax + _marketingSellTax` are calculated more than once. This can lead to an unnecessary computational cost.
\item \textbf{Solution:} Introduce intermediate variables to hold these values at the start of the function and use these variables in the places where these expressions were repeated.
\item \textbf{Implication Score:} Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. Using intermediate variables can actually improve readability and maintainability by reducing the complexity of expressions, without any impact on security.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{3. Overuse of Storage Variables in takeFee Function}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Discovery Process:} In the `takeFee` function, the `_balances[address(this)]` storage variable is updated. Storage operations are costly in terms of gas, and this operation could potentially be optimized.
\item \textbf{Solution:} It may not be possible to eliminate this storage operation, but if this function is frequently called in a loop or multiple times within a single transaction, consider accumulating the total fee amount in memory during the loop or transaction, and then updating the storage variable only once at the end.
\item \textbf{Implication Score:} Readability: 4; Security: 4; Maintainability: 4. This change could slightly reduce readability and maintainability, as developers would need to ensure the storage variable is correctly updated at the end of the loop or transaction. However, the impact on security should be minimal, provided that the update is implemented correctly.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{4. Pre-computable Operations in setTaxes Function}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Discovery Process:} In the `setTaxes` function, the input parameters are directly stored in state variables. If these parameters are simple and used in calculations later, we could potentially pre-compute some operations before storing them.
\item \textbf{Solution:} Depending on what the tax percentages represent and how they are used in later calculations, we could potentially store them in a different form (e.g., as fractions of a fixed denominator) to make later calculations cheaper.
\item \textbf{Implication Score:} Readability: 3; Security: 5; Maintainability: 3. This change could reduce readability and maintainability, as developers would need to remember the form in which these values are stored and ensure they are correctly converted before use. However, it should not impact security.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Note:} While these optimizations could potentially reduce gas costs, they should be considered and implemented carefully to ensure they do not introduce bugs or security vulnerabilities. Thorough testing is advised after any changes to the contract code.
