\subsection*{1. Redundant Storage Reads}

- \textbf{How did you find this pattern?}

  While examining the provided Solidity code, I noticed that certain storage variables such as `excludedFromFees[sender]` and `excludedFromFees[recipient]` are read multiple times in the `_transfer` function. Solidity stores variables in a key-value store called storage, and reading them is more costly than reading from memory.

- \textbf{What should I do to fix the found gas-wasting patterns?}

  To fix this, you could initialize memory variables at the beginning of the function to hold the values of `excludedFromFees[sender]` and `excludedFromFees[recipient]`, and use these memory variables throughout your function. Here's an example:

  ````solidity
  bool senderExcludedFromFees = excludedFromFees[sender];
  bool recipientExcludedFromFees = excludedFromFees[recipient];
  ```

  Now, replace all instances of `excludedFromFees[sender]` and `excludedFromFees[recipient]` with `senderExcludedFromFees` and `recipientExcludedFromFees`, respectively.

  ````

- \textbf{Effect on readability, security, and maintainability:}

  Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5

  This change doesn't affect the readability, security, or maintainability of the code. It merely moves the storage reads to memory reads, which are cheaper in terms of gas cost.

\subsection*{2. Repeated Computation of `address(this).balance`}

- \textbf{How did you find this pattern?}

  In the `swapForFees` function, `address(this).balance` is computed twice. Computation of the balance of the contract is not free and doing it repetitively is wasteful.

- \textbf{What should I do to fix the found gas-wasting patterns?}

  Similar to the first point, you could store the balance of the contract in a memory variable at the beginning of the function and use it throughout. Here's an example:

  ````solidity
  uint256 contractBalance = address(this).balance;
  ```

  Now replace all instances of `address(this).balance` with `contractBalance`.

  ````

- \textbf{Effect on readability, security, and maintainability:}

  Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5

  As with the previous point, this change doesn't affect the readability, security, or maintainability of the code. It merely reduces the gas cost by avoiding redundant balance computations.

\subsection*{3. Overuse of `sendValue`}

- \textbf{How did you find this pattern?}

  The `sendValue` function is used multiple times in the `swapForFees` function. This function transfers Ether (in Wei) to an address, and it includes a gas stipend of 2300 gas, which is not always necessary and could lead to wasteful gas usage.

- \textbf{What should I do to fix the found gas-wasting patterns?}

  Instead of using `sendValue`, consider using the `transfer` function instead. The `transfer` function also transfers Ether (in Wei) to an address, but it doesn't include a gas stipend. Here's an example:

  ````solidity
  payable(marketingWallet).transfer(marketingAmt);
  ```

  Now replace all instances of `sendValue` with `transfer`.

  ````

- \textbf{Effect on readability, security, and maintainability:}

  Readability: 5; Security: 4; Maintainability: 5

  The change doesn't affect the readability or maintainability of the code. However, it could potentially affect the security. The `transfer` function throws an exception if the transfer fails, which could result in a contract's state being reverted. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure that the contract can handle such exceptions gracefully.

For future requests, it would be helpful if you could also provide the related parts of your code (like the variable declarations and the simpler functions). This would give a more complete view of the contract and help identify more patterns.
