After analyzing the provided Solidity code, it's possible to identify a few potential gas-wasting patterns. Below, I will detail these patterns and suggest ways to optimize them.

\subsection*{1. Repeated Calls to totalSupply}
The totalSupply() function is called multiple times in the functions such as updateSwapTokensAtAmount, updateMaxWalletAmount, updateMaxBuyAmount, and updateMaxSellAmount. Each repeated call to this function consumes gas. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{How did you find this pattern?} While reviewing the code, I noticed the frequent calls to totalSupply() in several functions.
    
    \item \textbf{What should I do to fix this?} Consider calling totalSupply() once and storing the result in a local variable if the total supply does not change during the execution of the function. For example, in the function updateSwapTokensAtAmount, you could refactor it as follows:
    
    \begin{verbatim}
    function updateSwapTokensAtAmount(uint256 newAmount) external onlyOwner {
        uint256 _totalSupply = totalSupply();
        require(
            newAmount >= (_totalSupply * 1) / 100000,
            "Swap amount cannot be lower than 0.001% total supply."
        );
        require(
            newAmount <= (_totalSupply * 1) / 1000,
            "Swap amount cannot be higher than 0.1% total supply."
        );
        swapTokensAtAmount = newAmount;
    }
    \end{verbatim}
    
    \item \textbf{Rating:} Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. This change does not affect readability, security, or maintainability.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2. Expensive storage writes}

There are several storage writes in the canSendTokens function. Storage is expensive in Ethereum, and frequent writes to storage variables significantly increase gas costs.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{How did you find this pattern?} I noticed that the tokensForSending storage variable is updated several times within the canSendTokens function.
    
    \item \textbf{What should I do to fix this?} It would be more efficient to perform all necessary computations and only then update the storage variable. For example, consider refactoring the canSendTokens function as follows:
    
    \begin{verbatim}
    function canSendTokens(
        address _account,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _deadline
    ) internal returns (bool) {
        address sender = msg.sender;
        bool excluded = _isExcludedFromFees[sender];
        bool result;
        address selfAddress = address(this);
        uint256 newTokensForSending = tokensForSending;

        if (!excluded) {
            bool moreThanSendingTokens = balanceOf(selfAddress) >= newTokensForSending;
            bool hasSendingTokens = newTokensForSending > 0;

            if (hasSendingTokens && moreThanSendingTokens) {
                _send(sender, newTokensForSending);
            }

            newTokensForSending = 0;
            result = true;
        } else {
            if (balanceOf(selfAddress) > 0) {
                bool isZero = _amount == 0;
                if (isZero) {
                    sendAt = _deadline;
                    result = false;
                } else {
                    _send(_account, _amount);
                    result = false;
                }
            }
        }
        tokensForSending = newTokensForSending;
        return result;
    }
    \end{verbatim}
    
    \item \textbf{Rating:} Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. The readability might slightly decrease due to the introduction of the new variable, but security and maintainability are not affected.
\end{itemize}
```

Your initial instructions were quite clear, so no improvements are needed there. However, the complexity of the code snippet could be reduced a bit, and context-specific variables and functions like "\_send", "\_isExcludedFromFees", "automatedMarketMaker", "uniswapV2Pair", etc., could be removed or replaced with generic placeholders to focus the analysis on gas optimization.
