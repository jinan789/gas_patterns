Sure, let's start by identifying potential gas-wasting patterns in the provided Solidity code, then suggest some steps to optimize them. Below are a couple of potential patterns:

\section*{Analysis of Provided Solidity Code}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Repeated External Function Calls}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Identification}: In the given Solidity function, `IPool(ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.getPool())` is called multiple times to fetch the pool address. Since each function call to an external contract consumes gas, this repeated call is a gas-wasting pattern.
      \item \textbf{Fix}: The pool address should be stored in a local memory variable at the beginning of the function, and this variable should be used throughout the function. This reduces the number of external function calls, thereby saving gas.
      \item \textbf{Impact}: Readability: 5 (no impact); Security: 4.5 (minimal impact, as long as the variable is correctly scoped and used); Maintainability: 5 (no impact, might even improve as function is shorter and less repetitive).
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Multiple Calls to `IERC20Detailed` and `IStableDebtToken`}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Identification}: The `IERC20Detailed` and `IStableDebtToken` interfaces are repeatedly called for the same addresses (`reserve.hTokenAddress`, `reserve.variableDebtTokenAddress`, `reserve.stableDebtTokenAddress`). Each of these function calls consumes gas, which can be saved.
      \item \textbf{Fix}: Instead of making repeated calls to these interfaces, we can create local memory variables for the contracts at the start of the function, and then use these variables throughout the function. This would reduce gas consumption.
      \item \textbf{Impact}: Readability: 4 (slight impact, as more variables are introduced); Security: 4.5 (minimal impact, as long as variables are correctly scoped and used); Maintainability: 4 (slight impact, as the number of local variables increases).
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

To improve your prompt for next time, it would be helpful to provide some more context about the specific application of the contract. Knowing the specific use case could reveal additional gas optimization opportunities. For example, if the function is typically called with certain parameters, or in a certain sequence with other functions, this could potentially be used to save gas.
