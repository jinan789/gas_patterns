\section*{Analysis of Provided Solidity Code}

In the given Solidity contract, a couple of potential gas wasting patterns can be identified. They are:

\subsection*{1. Repeated Use of Storage Variables}

\subsubsection*{Discovery}
In the `continueStake` function, the `ticketMap`, `ticketCountMap`, and `rewardCycleMap` mappings are accessed multiple times. Each access to a storage variable consumes a significant amount of gas. The repeated access of these mappings, especially within for loops, is inefficient.

\subsubsection*{Solution}
To optimize gas usage, you should minimize the number of storage accesses. One way to do this is by assigning the required storage values to memory variables and then working with these memory variables. This is possible because memory is much cheaper than storage in terms of gas cost.

Here is how you could improve the `continueStake` function:

```solidity
function continueStake(uint256 previousCycleId) external previousCycle(previousCycleId) {
    uint256 cycleId = currentCycleId();
    uint256[] memory ticketIds = ticketUserMap[previousCycleId][msg.sender];
    if (ticketIds.length == 0) revert LengthMismatch();
    RewardCycle storage cycle_ = rewardCycleMap[previousCycleId];
    if (!cycle_.opened) revert IllegalOperation();

    for (uint256 i; i < ticketIds.length; i++) {
        Ticket storage ticket = ticketMap[previousCycleId][ticketIds[i]];
        if (ticket.user != msg.sender || ticket.redeemed) revert IllegalOperation();
        ticket.redeemed = true;
    }
    emit UnStake(previousCycleId, msg.sender, ticketIds.length);

    uint256 ticketIdCount = ticketCountMap[cycleId];
    for (uint256 i; i < ticketIds.length; i++) {
        ticketMap[cycleId][ticketIdCount + i] = Ticket({user: msg.sender, redeemed: false});
    }
    ticketCountMap[cycleId] = ticketIdCount + ticketIds.length;
    emit Stake(cycleId, msg.sender, ticketIds.length);
}
```

\subsubsection*{Impact}

- Readability: 4; The code is slightly less readable due to the additional memory variable.
- Security: 5; Implementing this pattern doesn't impact security.
- Maintainability: 4; A bit more complex due to the additional memory variable, but still quite maintainable.

\subsection*{2. Multiple Storage Writes}

\subsubsection*{Discovery}
In the `continueStake` function, the `ticketMap` and `ticketCountMap` storage mappings are updated inside a loop. Writing to storage is one of the most expensive operations in terms of gas, and doing this inside a loop is especially costly.

\subsubsection*{Solution}
You should aim to minimize the number of writes to storage. Instead of updating storage in each iteration of the loop, you could update a temporary variable and then update storage once after the loop.

Here's how you could implement this change:

```solidity
function continueStake(uint256 previousCycleId) external previousCycle(previousCycleId) {
    uint256 cycleId = currentCycleId();
    uint256[] memory ticketIds = ticketUserMap[previousCycleId][msg.sender];
    if (ticketIds.length == 0) revert LengthMismatch();
    RewardCycle storage cycle_ = rewardCycleMap[previousCycleId];
    if (!cycle_.opened) revert IllegalOperation();

    for (uint256 i; i < ticketIds.length; i++) {
        Ticket storage ticket = ticketMap[previousCycleId][ticketIds[i]];
        if (ticket.user != msg.sender || ticket.redeemed) revert IllegalOperation();
        ticket.redeemed = true;
    }
    emit UnStake(previousCycleId, msg.sender, ticketIds.length);

    uint256 ticketIdCount = ticketCountMap[cycleId];
    Ticket[] memory newTickets = new Ticket[](ticketIds.length);
    for (uint256 i; i < ticketIds.length; i++) {
        newTickets[i] = Ticket({user: msg.sender, redeemed: false});
    }
    for (uint256 i; i < newTickets.length; i++) {
        ticketMap[cycleId][ticketIdCount + i] = newTickets[i];
    }
    ticketCountMap[cycleId] = ticketIdCount + newTickets.length;
    emit Stake(cycleId, msg.sender, newTickets.length);
}
```

\subsubsection*{Impact}

- Readability: 4; The code is slightly less readable due to the additional memory array.
- Security: 5; There is no impact on security.
- Maintainability: 4; There is a slight increase in complexity due to the additional memory array, but the code remains maintainable.

As for your additional requirements, your prompt was clear and provided sufficient information. However, for future requests, you mightwant to consider including the complete contract or at least the related parts of the contract. This could provide more context and potentially reveal other gas-wasting patterns that are not apparent from an isolated function. 

Please note that the above analysis assumes that the additional gas cost for increased memory usage is less than the savings from reducing storage operations. It's also important to remember that while the suggested optimizations can reduce gas costs, they may also make the code more complex and harder to understand. Therefore, it's crucial to strike a balance between gas optimization, readability, and maintainability.
