The provided Solidity code has a few potential areas where gas wastage could occur, which aren't covered by the listed patterns. These new patterns include:

1. **Unnecessary Function Calls**

   The code contains multiple instances where there are repeated calls to the same function that return the same result. For example, in the `newVote` function, `voteToken.allowance(msg.sender, address(this))` and `voteToken.balanceOf(msg.sender)` are each called twice when once would suffice.

   To fix this issue, you could store the result of the function call in a variable and reuse it, reducing the number of unnecessary function calls. The reasoning behind this is that function calls, especially external ones, are expensive in terms of gas.

   `````solidity
   uint256 allowance = voteToken.allowance(msg.sender, address(this));
   uint256 balance = voteToken.balanceOf(msg.sender);
   require(allowance >= newVoteDeposit, "allowance of ferc as deposit not enough");
   require(balance >= newVoteDeposit, "balance of ferc as deposit not enough");
   ```

   Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5; This refactoring has no impact on readability, security, or maintainability.

2. **Repeated State Variable Accesses**

   In the `addVote` function, `applications[_tick]` is accessed multiple times. Each read from a state variable consumes gas, so reducing the number of reads can save gas.

   To fix this issue, you could read the state variable once into memory and then operate on the memory copy. The reasoning behind this is that reading from memory is cheaper than reading from storage in terms of gas.

   ````solidity
   IVoteForLaunch.Application storage application = applications[_tick];
   application.totalVotes += _ballots;
   application.topVotes = application.totalVotes;
   ...
   ```

   Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5; This refactoring has no impact on readability, security, or maintainability.

3. **Unoptimized Loop**

   The `getVotedApplications` function contains a loop that iterates over the `tickArray` and performs multiple operations. This can lead to high gas costs if the array size is large.

   This is a complex issue, and there's no easy fix without changing the contract's logic or storage structure. One possible optimization is to limit the number of items processed in a single call and allow multiple calls to process the entire array. The reasoning behind this is that processing fewer items per transaction can reduce the gas cost.

   Readability: 3; Security: 4; Maintainability: 3; This refactoring might impact readability and maintainability as it changes the function's behavior and might require additional logic to handle multiple calls.

As for the prompt, it was clear and well-described. The only thing that would have been helpful is to have a brief description of what each function in the contract does. This would help in understanding the contract's overall logic and potentially identifying more areas for gas optimization.

The reasoning process mainly involved understanding the contract's logic, identifying areas where gas-intensive operations were happening, and then seeing if these could be optimized. For future tasks, it might be helpful to have a more systematic approach to analyzing the contract, such as checking each function individually and then looking at the contract as a whole.
