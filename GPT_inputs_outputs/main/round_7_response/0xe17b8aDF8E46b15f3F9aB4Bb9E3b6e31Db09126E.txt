## New Gas-Wasting Pattern
Below is one new gas-wasting pattern I found from the provided Solidity code:

- **"Redundant Condition Check"**: This pattern occurs when the same condition is checked multiple times unnecessarily, leading to unnecessary gas consumption. For instance, in the `transferFrom` function, the condition `!frozen[_to]` is checked twice which is not necessary if the state of the `_to` address is not changing during the execution of the function.

### 1. How did you find this pattern? Could you explain the reasoning process, step by step, behind the discovery?

I examined each function in the provided Solidity code and identified the patterns that were similar to the example gas-wasting patterns. I noticed that some conditions were checked more than once within the same function execution. Knowing that each condition check consumes gas and that the state of the variables used in the condition is not changing during the function execution, I identified this as a new gas-wasting pattern.

### 2. What should I do, step by step, to fix the found gas-wasting patterns? Could you explain the reasoning process, step by step, behind the reason why such a fix works?

To fix the "Redundant Condition Check" pattern, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify the conditions that are checked multiple times in the same function.
2. Determine if the state of the variables used in these conditions can change during the function execution. If the state can change, then the multiple condition checks might be necessary. If the state cannot change, proceed to the next step.
3. Remove the redundant condition checks. Make sure the logic of the function remains correct after the removal.
4. Test the function to ensure it behaves as expected.

The fix works because it removes unnecessary operations that consume gas. Since the state of the variables used in the conditions is not changing during the function execution, there is no need to check the same condition multiple times.

### 3. On a score of 0 to 5, please rate this new pattern in terms of how much it is sacrificing readability, security, and maintainability in exchange for gas optimization (5 is the least impacted. For example, "Readability: 5; Security: 4; Maintainability: 1" means no effect on security while maintainability is largely affected.)

- Readability: 5
- Security: 5
- Maintainability: 5

This fix should have minimal impact on readability, security, and maintainability. The code is just as easy to read, the security is not impacted because the logic remains the same, and the code is just as maintainable because fewer condition checks make the code simpler.

## Additional Feedback

1. Your prompt is clear and understandable. However, it would be helpful to provide a more extensive list of known gas-wasting patterns and more examples of such patterns in the code. This would provide a better starting point for finding new patterns.

2. For this task, I focused on identifying similarities between the example gas-wasting patterns and the patterns in the provided code. I could improve my reasoning process by also considering the unique characteristics of Solidity and the Ethereum Virtual Machine, such as how storage and memory work, how gas is calculated, etc. This might help me find additional gas-wasting patterns. In terms of improving my output, I provided a clear and detailed explanation of the new pattern, how to fix it, and its impact on readability, security, and maintainability. To further improve, I could provide more examples of the new pattern in the provided code and more detailed instructions on how to fix it.
