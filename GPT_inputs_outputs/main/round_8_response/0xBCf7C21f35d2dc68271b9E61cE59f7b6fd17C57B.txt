I've reviewed the provided code and here are some new gas-inefficient patterns I've found:

1. **Unnecessary function calls**: The function `viewLatestStage()` is called multiple times in the code. Function calls are expensive in terms of gas, so unnecessary calls should be avoided. This pattern was found by examining the code for function calls and then checking to see if the result of the function could be stored and reused instead of calling the function multiple times.

   **Solution**: The result from `viewLatestStage()` could be stored in a local variable and reused. This can be done by adding `uint256 latestStage = viewLatestStage();` near the start of the function and replacing all other calls to `viewLatestStage()` with this variable. This reduces the gas cost by not requiring multiple function calls. 

   **Impact**: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. This change should not impact the readability, security, or maintainability of the code.

2. **Repeatedly accessing mapping values**: The mapping `stageMap` is accessed multiple times for the same keys. Accessing a mapping is more expensive than accessing a local variable or memory.

   **Solution**: When accessing a mapping value more than once, you should store the value in a local variable and use that instead. In this code, you could store `stageMap[i - 1]` and `stageMap[startId]` in local variables when they are first accessed and use those variables in the subsequent code.

   **Impact**: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4. This change should not impact the readability or security of the code, but it may slightly decrease maintainability because developers need to remember to update the local variable if the mapping value changes.

3. **Repeatedly checking the same condition**: The condition `newStage.startTime <= block.timestamp` is checked multiple times. Conditions that don't change should be checked only once and the result stored for later use.

   **Solution**: Store the result of `newStage.startTime <= block.timestamp` in a local variable and use that variable in the subsequent conditions. This reduces the computational overhead of evaluating the same condition multiple times.
   
   **Impact**: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. This change should not impact the readability, security, or maintainability of the code.

4. **Checking conditions that will always be true**: For example, `startId > currentTotalStages` will always be false because `startId` is defined as `uint256` and can never be larger than `currentTotalStages`, which is also a `uint256`.

   **Solution**: Remove unnecessary conditions that will always be true or false. They just consume unnecessary gas.

   **Impact**: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. This change should not impact the readability, security, or maintainability of the code.

In terms of improving your prompt, it would be helpful if you could provide a little more information on the context and functionality of the contract. Understanding the contract's purpose and how its functions are expected to be used can provide valuable insights when looking for gas inefficiencies.

As for the reasoning process, actively looking for patterns of inefficiency in the code, such as repeated operations, unnecessary operations, and inefficient data access patterns, can help to identify potential areas for improvement. However, it's also important to strike a balance between gas optimization and code readability and maintainability. Too many optimizations can make the code hard to read and maintain, which could potentially introduce new bugs or security vulnerabilities.
