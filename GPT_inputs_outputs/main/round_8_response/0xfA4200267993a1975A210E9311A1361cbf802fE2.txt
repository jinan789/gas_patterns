Here's a new gas inefficiency pattern I found in the provided code, and how it can be fixed:

1. **Multiple Storage Reads of Structs:** The code has a pattern where it reads from storage multiple times to access different members of the same struct. In Solidity, every storage read costs gas, so this is inefficient. The example in the code is in the `getStream` function where `_streams[streamId]` is called multiple times to access different struct members.

   **How I found it:** I noticed that the `_streams[streamId]` was accessed multiple times within the `getStream` function. This stood out as a potential gas inefficiency because each read operation from the storage costs gas. In Solidity, storage is expensive compared to memory, so repeated storage reads can quickly add up to a significant gas cost.

   **Fixing the issue:** The solution to this problem is to load the entire struct into memory once, and then access its members from memory, which is significantly cheaper in terms of gas cost. Here's how to fix it:
   `````solidity
   function getStream(uint256 streamId)
    external
    view
    streamExists(streamId)
    returns (
      address sender,
      address recipient,
      uint256 deposit,
      address tokenAddress,
      uint256 startTime,
      uint256 stopTime,
      uint256 remainingBalance,
      uint256 ratePerSecond
    )
  {
    Stream memory stream = _streams[streamId];
    sender = stream.sender;
    recipient = stream.recipient;
    deposit = stream.deposit;
    tokenAddress = stream.tokenAddress;
    startTime = stream.startTime;
    stopTime = stream.stopTime;
    remainingBalance = stream.remainingBalance;
    ratePerSecond = stream.ratePerSecond;
  }
   ```
   **Reasoning:** Reading the entire struct into memory at once costs only one storage read operation, and subsequent reads from memory are much cheaper. This reduces the total gas cost for executing the function.
   
   **Impact Score:** Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. The fix does not negatively impact the readability, security or maintainability of the contract. It actually improves readability by reducing the number of repeated `_streams[streamId]` calls.

2. **Improving the Prompt:** This was a well-written prompt. However, it could be improved by providing more context about the purpose of the contract and its functions. This would help in understanding the intended functionality and possible optimizations. For example, what is the role of the `AdminControlledEcosystemReserve`, `ReentrancyGuard`, and `IStreamable` in this contract? What do these functions do and how are they expected to be used?

3. **Reflecting on the Reasoning Process:** My reasoning process involved understanding the functionality of the contract, identifying repeated patterns, and considering how these patterns could be made more efficient. I could improve my process by studying more about the gas cost of different operations in Solidity, which would allow me to identify inefficiencies more quickly. For this task, my understanding of the high gas cost of storage operations in Solidity helped me identify the issue.
