Here are some new patterns of gas-wasting I found:

\subsection*{1. Redundant Balance and Allowance Checks}
In the `newVote`, `withdrawNewVote`, `deposit`, and `withdraw` functions, there are checks for both allowance and balance of tokens. This might be unnecessary and wasteful since allowance check already ensures that the sender has allowed the contract to spend a certain amount of tokens on his behalf. If allowance is sufficient, it implies that the balance is also sufficient.

- \textbf{Finding Process:} I noticed this pattern by examining the `require` statements in these functions. It's common to check for allowance in token-related operations, but checking both allowance and balance seems redundant.
- \textbf{Fix:} Remove the checks for `voteToken.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= newVoteDeposit` and `voteToken.balanceOf(msg.sender) >= _amount` in the `newVote`, `deposit`, and `withdraw` functions. The allowance check is enough to ensure that the sender has the required amount of tokens.
- \textbf{Impact Rating:} Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. This change does not affect the readability, security, or maintainability of the code. It only removes unnecessary gas consumption and makes it more efficient.

\subsection*{2. Repeated Calls to `block.timestamp`}
In the `newVote` and `addVote` functions, `block.timestamp` is called multiple times. Each call to `block.timestamp` consumes gas, and the value doesn't change within the same transaction. Thus, it's more gas-efficient to read `block.timestamp` once and store it in a local variable if it's used more than once.

- \textbf{Finding Process:} I found this pattern by looking for repeated calls to global variables like `block.timestamp`. Repeated calls to the same global variable within a function often indicate potential for optimization.
- \textbf{Fix:} Create a local variable `uint40 currentTime = uint40(block.timestamp);` at the beginning of the `newVote` and `addVote` functions and replace all occurrences of `block.timestamp` in these functions with `currentTime`.
- \textbf{Impact Rating:} Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. This change does not affect the readability, security, or maintainability of the code. It makes the code more efficient without any trade-offs.

\subsection*{3. Inefficient Storage Usage}
In the `addVote` function, the `applications[_tick]` struct is read from storage multiple times. Each read from storage consumes a significant amount of gas. It's more efficient to read the entire struct into memory once and then work with the memory copy.

- \textbf{Finding Process:} I found this pattern by looking for repeated accesses to storage variables. In Solidity, reading from and writing to storage is much more expensive than reading from and writing to memory.
- \textbf{Fix:} At the beginning of the `addVote` function, add `IVoteForLaunch.Application memory application = applications[_tick];`. Then, replace all occurrences of `applications[_tick]` in the function with `application`. Remember to write back to storage at the end of the function with `applications[_tick] = application;`.
- \textbf{Impact Rating:} Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4. This change slightly reduces readability and maintainability, as developers need to remember to write back to storage. However, it doesn't affect security and significantly increases gas efficiency.

For your next time, I suggest providing the implementation details (if any) related to the external libraries used in the contract. In this case, `TransferHelper` and `IVoteForLaunch` are used, but their implementation details are not given, which might affect the analysis. Also, providing a bit of context about the contract's purpose could help in understanding the code better.
