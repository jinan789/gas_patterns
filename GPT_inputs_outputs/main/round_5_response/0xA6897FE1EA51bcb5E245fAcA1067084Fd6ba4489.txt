From the provided Solidity code, we can identify several gas-inefficient patterns not covered in the listed examples. Below, we will enumerate these patterns and provide explanations on how they're discovered, how they can be fixed, and the impact of these fixes on readability, security, and maintainability.

\subsection*{1. Repeated Contract Interactions}

- Discovery: In the `viewPool()` function, we observe multiple calls to the same functions of external contracts, such as `apeCoinStaking.getCurrentTimeRange()`. Each interaction with a contract consumes gas, thus multiple interactions can be quite costly.
- Fix: Instead of making multiple calls to the same function, we can store the result of the first call in a memory variable and reuse it. The revised code would look like this:

```solidity
ApeStakingLib.TimeRange memory baycTimeRange = apeCoinStaking.getCurrentTimeRange(ApeStakingLib.BAYC_POOL_ID);
poolState.baycPoolMaxCap = baycTimeRange.capPerPosition;
```

- Impact:
  - Readability: 5; The change does not significantly impact readability, as it still follows common programming practices.
  - Security: 5; Since we're just storing and reusing the result of a function call, there should be no security implications.
  - Maintainability: 4; The change should not affect the overall maintainability of the code. However, developers need to be aware that they should update the local variable whenever the original state may have changed.

\subsection*{2. Looping over Arrays of Unknown Length}

- Discovery: In the `viewBakcPairingStatus()` and `getStakedNftCount()` functions, we are looping over input arrays of an unknown length. This could potentially consume high gas if the array is large.
- Fix: Instead of accepting arrays as inputs, we can refactor the functions to accept a single element at a time. This changes the gas costs from being dependent on the size of the array to being constant. The clients of the contract can then call these functions in a loop if they need to process multiple elements.
- Impact:
  - Readability: 3; The change somewhat reduces readability, as it shifts part of the logic (looping over arrays) from the contract to its clients.
  - Security: 5; Since we're just shifting the processing from on-chain to off-chain, there should be no security implications.
  - Maintainability: 2; The change makes the contract simpler but puts more burden on the clients of the contract. This could potentially make it harder to maintain the overall system.

\subsection*{3. Inefficient Calculation}

- Discovery: In the `viewPoolPendingRewards()` function, the code performs the same calculation (`staker.calculateFee()`) multiple times on the same variables. This is inefficient and consumes more gas.
- Fix: We can store the result of the calculation in a memory variable and reuse it. The revised code would look like this:

```solidity
uint256 coinPoolFee = staker.calculateFee(rewards.coinPoolRewards);
rewards.coinPoolRewards -= coinPoolFee;
```

- Impact:
  - Readability: 5; The change does not significantly impact readability, as it still follows common programming practices.
  - Security: 5; Since we're just storing and reusing the result of a function call, there should be no security implications.
  - Maintainability: 4; The change should not affect the overall maintainability of the code. However, developers need to be aware that they should update the local variable whenever the original state may have changed.

For future similar prompts, it would be helpful to provide some additional context or constraints about the contract's clients and how they are expected to use it. This is because some gas optimization techniques may shift the burden from the contract to its clients, and whether this is acceptable depends on the specific use case.
