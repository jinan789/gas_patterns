After carefully reviewing the provided Solidity code, there are several potential gas-wasting patterns that we can identify and optimize. Here are a few:

\subsection*{1. Repeated Access of Storage Variables}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{How did you find this pattern?}

The pattern of repeated access to storage variables was identified by noticing the multiple instances where `ledger[msg.sender][i]` is accessed. This is a gas-intensive operation, as accessing storage variables consumes more gas compared to accessing a memory variable.

\item \textbf{What should I do, step by step, to fix the found gas-wasting patterns?}

We can optimize this pattern by reducing the number of times `ledger[msg.sender][i]` is accessed. This can be achieved by assigning the value of `ledger[msg.sender][i]` to a memory variable at the beginning of the function, and then updating the storage variable only once at the end of the function.

Here's a high-level overview of the steps involved in this optimization:

- Create a new memory variable `Record memory rec = ledger[msg.sender][i]`.
- Replace all instances of `ledger[msg.sender][i]` with `rec`.
- At the end of the function, update the storage variable once with `ledger[msg.sender][i] = rec`.

\item \textbf{How would you rate this found new pattern?}

- \textit{Readability: 4.5;} The readability is slightly reduced because a developer needs to understand that `rec` represents `ledger[msg.sender][i]`, but it is still clear what the code is doing.
- \textit{Security: 5;} The security is not affected by this change.
- \textit{Maintainability: 4;} The maintainability is slightly reduced because future changes to the struct will need to ensure that the memory variable `rec` is updated appropriately.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection*{2. Repeated Computation of `block.timestamp.sub(ledger[msg.sender][i].from)`}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{How did you find this pattern?}

This pattern was identified by noticing that both `get_gains` and `get_gains2` perform the same computation of `block.timestamp.sub(ledger[msg.sender][i].from)`. This is wasteful and can be optimized.

\item \textbf{What should I do, step by step, to fix the found gas-wasting patterns?}

We can optimize this pattern by computing `block.timestamp.sub(ledger[msg.sender][i].from)` once and passing the result as a parameter to `get_gains` and `get_gains2`. Here are the steps for this optimization:

- Compute `block.timestamp.sub(ledger[msg.sender][i].from)` once in the `end` function and assign it to a variable, say `recordSeconds`.
- Pass `recordSeconds` as an additional parameter to both `get_gains` and `get_gains2`.
- Replace the computation of `block.timestamp.sub(ledger[_address][_rec_number].from)` in `get_gains` and `get_gains2` with `recordSeconds`.

\item \textbf{How would you rate this found new pattern?}

- \textit{Readability: 4;} The readability is slightly reduced because now the functions `get_gains` and `get_gains2` have an additional parameter whose origin isn't immediately clear without looking at the `end` function.
- \textit{Security: 5;} The security is not affected by this change.
- \textit{Maintainability: 4;} The maintainability is slightly reduced because future changes to the functions will need to ensure that the new parameter is correctly passed and used.
  \end{itemize}

\textbf{Suggestions for improvement of the prompt:}

The prompt was clear and well-structured, providing necessary context and example for the task at hand. However, it could be improved by providing more context around the real-world usage of the contract, as this could help in identifying more potential optimizations.
