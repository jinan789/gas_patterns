After analyzing the Solidity code provided, several potential gas-wasting patterns were detected. Below are detailed explanations of each identified pattern, along with suggested solutions and the reasoning behind them.

1. **"Repeating Expensive Operations."**
    1. The `IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this))` operation is called twice, once in the `\_compound` function and once in the `\_getProtocolRewardsInternal` function. This operation is expensive as it accesses the state of the EVM, and its repetition could be a source of wasted gas.
    2. To fix this, a local variable could be used to store the result of the first `balanceOf` call, which can then be reused in the `\_getProtocolRewardsInternal` function. This change would save the gas cost of a second `balanceOf` call.
    3. If the code provided is part of a larger contract, it would be beneficial to provide the entirety of the contract to analyze any additional gas-wasting patterns that may exist. 

2. **"Redundant Conditional Statements."**
    1. The if statement `if (balance > 0)` in the `\_getProtocolRewardsInternal` function seems to be redundant. The `safeTransfer` function from the OpenZeppelin library (which is likely used here) already includes a condition to check if the value is greater than 0.
    2. To fix this, the `if (balance > 0)` statement can be removed. The `safeTransfer` function will not execute if the balance is 0, so this change will not affect the functionality of the contract but will save the gas used for this unnecessary condition.
    3. As the provided code does not include all the libraries used, it would be beneficial to include these libraries to confirm assumptions about the functions used in the code, such as `safeTransfer`.

3. **"Unnecessary State Updates."**
    1. The `\_lastIdleTokenPrice` state variable is updated in the `\_getYieldPercentage` function. If this function is called multiple times without any change in the `currentIdleTokenPrice`, this state update is unnecessary and would waste gas.
    2. To fix this, a condition can be added to check if `currentIdleTokenPrice` has changed before updating `\_lastIdleTokenPrice`. By adding this condition, we can avoid unnecessary state updates and save gas.
    3. It would be beneficial to get more specific information about when and how often certain functions are called, as this information can influence the identification and fixing of gas-wasting patterns.

\section*{Suggestions for Future Prompts}

To improve future prompts, it would be beneficial to provide more context about the contract's purpose, how its functions are used, and any known constraints or requirements. This information can help in identifying gas-wasting patterns and suggesting efficient solutions. Additionally, including the entire contract and any used libraries would be useful to avoid making assumptions about the code.
