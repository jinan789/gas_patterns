It's important to note that optimizing Solidity code for gas consumption can be a complex task and require deep understanding of Solidity, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the specific use cases of the contract. For the provided Solidity code, it looks well-optimized. However, there are a few points to consider:

1. **Use of SafeMath library for arithmetic operations**
   - Reasoning: The SafeMath library was used in older versions of Solidity that did not have built-in protection against arithmetic overflow/underflow. Since Solidity 0.8.0, this protection is built-in, so the use of SafeMath can be considered a gas-wasting pattern. This was found by observing the use of the SafeMath `.sub` function in the `_approve` function.
   - Fix: Remove the SafeMath library and use native arithmetic operations. For example, replace `_allowances[sender][_msgSender()].sub(amount, "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance")` with `_allowances[sender][_msgSender()] - amount`.
   - Reasoning: By removing the use of SafeMath library and using the built-in arithmetic operations, you are eliminating the extra function calls that are associated with SafeMath, therefore, saving gas.

2. **Use of public variable setters**
   - Reasoning: There is a number of public variables in the contract. If these variables are not meant to be changed dynamically, they could be set as `constant` or `immutable` to save gas. This reduces gas costs as the EVM does not have to reserve storage for these variables.
   - Fix: If these variables are not meant to be changed dynamically, you can set them as `constant` or `immutable`. For example, `uint256 public _maxTxAmount = 20909090909090 * 10**_decimals;` can be changed to `uint256 public constant _maxTxAmount = 20909090909090 * 10**_decimals;`.
   - Reasoning: By declaring variables as `constant` or `immutable`, their values are set at compile-time, which saves gas as the EVM does not have to reserve storage for these variables during each call.

In terms of improving the prompt, it would be beneficial if you could provide more specific details about the expected behavior of the contract. This would allow for more accurate recommendations. Also, it would be helpful to know the Solidity version that the contract is using, as different versions have different features that might affect gas optimization strategies. For instance, the use of the SafeMath library is unnecessary in Solidity 0.8.0 and later, but might be needed in earlier versions. Furthermore, knowing the intended behavior of the contract would allow for a more accurate analysis, as some "inefficiencies" might be necessary for the contract to behave as expected in certain scenarios.
