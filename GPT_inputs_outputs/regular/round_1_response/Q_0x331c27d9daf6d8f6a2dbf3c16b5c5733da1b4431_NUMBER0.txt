Upon analyzing the provided Solidity code, several potential gas wasting patterns have been identified. These are discussed in detail below:

\subsection*{1. Redundant Address Check}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Discovery process:} The constructor of the contract `AaveV2Strategy` checks if the provided `ILendingPoolAddressesProvider` address is equal to zero, and if so, it reverts the transaction. However, this check is not necessary because the Solidity programming language itself prevents the creation of a contract at address zero.
    \item \textbf{Fix:} To optimize gas usage, it is recommended to remove the address zero check in the constructor. The fix would involve removing the following lines of code:
    \begin{verbatim}
        if (address(provider_) == address(0)) {
            revert ConfigurationAddressZero();
        }
    \end{verbatim}
    \item \textbf{Reasoning:} Removing this redundant check will save gas because the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) will not have to execute these unnecessary lines of code.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2. Repeated Calls to External Contracts}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Discovery process:} In various places in the code, there are multiple external calls to the same function of the `ILendingPool` contract (an external contract). For instance, in the `initialize` and `\_getYieldPercentage` functions, `getReserveNormalizedIncome` and `getLendingPool` are each called twice. Each external call to a function in another contract consumes a considerable amount of gas.
    \item \textbf{Fix:} Instead of making multiple calls to the same function, the return value of the function call should be stored in a variable and this variable should be used where the function's return value is required. For example, in the `initialize` function, the fix would look like this:
    \begin{verbatim}
        ILendingPool pool = provider.getLendingPool();
        aToken = IERC20(pool.getReserveData(tokens[0]).aTokenAddress);
        _lastNormalizedIncome = pool.getReserveNormalizedIncome(tokens[0]);
    \end{verbatim}
    \item \textbf{Reasoning:} Each external call to a function in another contract consumes a considerable amount of gas. By reducing the number of external calls, gas can be saved.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{3. Redundant Memory Array Initialization}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Discovery process:} In several functions, new memory arrays are initialized with a fixed size and then populated with values. For instance, in the `assetRatio` function, a new memory array `\_assetRatio` is initialized and then the first element is set to 1. However, this pattern is unnecessary and wastes gas because it's possible to initialize and populate a memory array in one step.
    \item \textbf{Fix:} Instead of initializing a new memory array and then populating it, it's recommended to initialize and populate the array in one step. Here's how the fix would look in the `assetRatio` function:
    \begin{verbatim}
        return [1];
    \end{verbatim}
    \item \textbf{Reasoning:} Initializing and populating an array in one step uses less gas than doing it in two separate steps. This is because the EVM only needs to allocate and write to memory once, rather than twice.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Suggestions for Next Time}

The given prompt was quite clear and provided a good framework for analyzing the Solidity code. However, it could be beneficial to provide a bit more context about the overall purpose and functionality of the contract. Understanding the broader context of how the contract functions and interacts with other contracts could potentially reveal more nuanced gas-wasting patterns. Additionally, if there are specific areas of concern or areas where performance seems to be sub-optimal, pointing those out could help focus the analysis and potentially yield more relevant results.
