After a careful inspection of the provided Solidity code, several potential gas-wasting patterns have been identified. Following are those patterns with detailed explanations and suggestions for improvements.

\subsection*{1. Redundant Condition Check}

In the provided Solidity code, there are multiple instances where the same condition is checked repeatedly. One such instance is visible in the `\_redeemFromProtocol` function, where `slippages[0]` is checked multiple times to determine the `slippage` value.

\subsubsection*{Finding Process}
The redundant condition check pattern was identified by observing that the `slippages[0]` value is used in multiple conditional statements to assign different values to the `slippage` variable in the same function.

\subsubsection*{Fix}
The recommended fix for this pattern is to use a mapping or a switch case to eliminate the redundancy. This would only require a single condition check for `slippages[0]` rather than multiple, reducing the gas cost in the process. The switch case structure provides a more readable and efficient form of multiple if-else statements by reducing the number of comparisons.

\subsubsection*{Improvements to the Prompt}
The prompt provided is sufficiently detailed for the task. However, it can be improved by providing more background information about the code. For example, information about what each function does, the role and structure of the `slippages` array, etc., would be helpful in understanding the context, which in turn would enable a more accurate identification of gas-wasting patterns.

\subsection*{2. Multiple Calls to the Same Function}

Another pattern observed in the code is the repeated calls to the same function. Specifically, the function `idleToken.balanceOf(address(this))` is called multiple times within the same contract, which leads to higher gas consumption.

\subsubsection*{Finding Process}
This pattern was identified by observing the repeated calls to `idleToken.balanceOf(address(this))` in different functions such as `getUnderlyingAssetAmounts`,`\_redeemFromProtocol`, and`\_emergencyWithdrawImpl`.

\subsubsection*{Fix}
To fix this pattern, consider storing the result of `idleToken.balanceOf(address(this))` in a variable if it is expected to be used multiple times within a short span (e.g., within the same function or within a single transaction). This helps to avoid repeated calls to the same function, thereby saving gas.

\subsubsection*{Improvements to the Prompt}
The prompt is already quite clear and detailed. However, providing additional context about the expected frequency of calls to each function could be beneficial. Knowing which functions are expected to be called frequently can help identify potential areas for improvement more easily.

\section*{General Suggestions for the Prompt}

For similar tasks in the future, it would be helpful to have more context about the functions and their inputs. For instance, knowing more about the `slippages` array and why it is used in the way it is could help identify more potential gas-wasting patterns. Moreover, explaining the intended functionality of the contract would allow for a more focused and effective analysis. This is because understanding the contract's goal and how it works would enable the identification of unnecessary computations or operations that could be removed or simplified to save gas.
