Thanks for the detailed request. Below are some potential gas-wasting patterns I found in your provided Solidity code. For each pattern, I'll explain how I found it, how to fix it, and rate the impact of the fix on readability, security, and maintainability.

1. **Repeatedly retrieving token balances**
    - Discovery: In the function `_convertPositionToFullRange`, the balance of tokens `mintParams.token0` and `mintParams.token1` are retrieved twice. Once to set `mintParams.amount0Desired` and `mintParams.amount1Desired`, and again to set `balance0` and `balance1`.
    - Fix: The balances could be retrieved once and stored in a local variable. These variables can then be used to set `mintParams.amount0Desired` and `mintParams.amount1Desired`, and later compared to zero.
    - Impact:
        - Readability: 5 (It's common practice to avoid repeated function calls)
        - Security: 5 (No security impact)
        - Maintainability: 5 (Reducing the number of function calls can make debugging easier)

2. **Repeated computation of `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_name))`**
    - Discovery: In the function `addOrEditFee`, the hash of `_name` is computed twice for the same input. Once for `nameHash` and again when checking if `FEE_LOOKUP` contains the hash.
    - Fix: The calculated `nameHash` should be reused in the `FEE_LOOKUP.contains` call.
    - Impact:
        - Readability: 5 (It's a straightforward change)
        - Security: 5 (No security impact)
        - Maintainability: 5 (It's easier to maintain and understand)

3. **Repeated access to `params.nftPositionManager`**
    - Discovery: In the `lock` function, `params.nftPositionManager` is accessed numerous times. This value could be stored in a local variable to save gas.
    - Fix: Save `params.nftPositionManager` in a local variable at the start of the function and use this variable throughout.
    - Impact:
        - Readability: 4 (The change is minor but could potentially make the function slightly harder to understand)
        - Security: 5 (No impact on security)
        - Maintainability: 4 (The change is minor but could potentially make the function slightly harder to maintain)

4. **Repeated computation of `position.tickLower != -maxTick && position.tickUpper != maxTick`**
    - Discovery: In the `lock` function, this condition is computed twice. Once in the if statement and again in the else statement.
    - Fix: Compute the condition once and store it in a boolean variable. Use this variable in the if and else statements.
    - Impact:
        - Readability: 5 (It's common practice to store the result of a condition in a variable)
        - Security: 5 (No security impact)
        - Maintainability: 5 (Makes the code easier to maintain and understand)

For any ambiguities or lack of information, I believe your prompt was clearly explained and detailed, making it easy to follow. However, it would be helpful to know if there are any specific constraints or requirements for the code, like maintaining a certain level of security or readability.

Reflecting on the reasoning process, a thorough understanding of Ethereum and Solidity can help in identifying potential gas-wasting patterns. However, it's always beneficial to consider the trade-offs between gas optimization and other factors like readability, security, and maintainability. In terms of improvements, it's important to continue staying up-to-date with best practices and new features in Solidity which may provide more efficient ways to write contracts.
