After analyzing the provided Solidity code, several potential gas-wasting patterns have been detected. These patterns are as follows:

\subsection*{1. Unnecessary Keccak256 Hash Computations}

In the `clearCredits` and `_nonblockingLzReceive` functions, the payload is hashed using `keccak256` multiple times. In `clearCredits`, it is performed twice, while in `_nonblockingLzReceive`, it is performed once.

\subsubsection*{Finding Process}

This pattern was identified by observing the repeated usage of the `keccak256` hash function on the same payload in the `clearCredits` and `_nonblockingLzReceive` functions. Hash computations are relatively expensive operations in terms of gas in Ethereum.

\subsubsection*{Solution}

The solution to this problem is to store the hash of the payload in a local variable and then use this variable whenever the hash of the payload is required. This would reduce the number of hash computations, thus saving gas.

\subsubsection*{Impact Score}

Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5.

The change does not affect the readability, security, or maintainability of the contract. It only alters the way the repeated hash computation is managed.

\subsection*{2. Redundant Check in `_creditTo` function}

In the `_creditTo` function, the `exists` boolean is checked twice. This operation is unnecessary and adds additional computational overhead.

\subsubsection*{Finding Process}

This pattern was identified by observing the repeated checks of the `exists` boolean in the `_creditTo` function. This operation is not necessary and results in extra gas usage.

\subsubsection*{Solution}

The solution to this problem is to restructure the logic of the function to eliminate the redundant check. For example, you could structure the code as follows:

```solidity
IOmniseaRemoteERC721 collection = IOmniseaRemoteERC721(_collection);
bool exists = collection.exists(_tokenId);
require(!exists || collection.ownerOf(_tokenId) == address(this));

if (!exists) {
    collection.mint(_toAddress, _tokenId);
} else {
    collection.transferFrom(address(this), _toAddress, _tokenId);
}
```

\subsubsection*{Impact Score}

Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5.

The change enhances the readability of the contract without affecting its security or maintainability.
