In the provided Solidity code, we can identify a few areas where gas usage might be inefficient. These areas correspond to patterns of computation that might be optimized for better gas efficiency. Here are a few patterns:

1. **Redundant conditional checks**

   - How did you find this pattern? By examining the `_transferFrom` function, it can be observed that `lockedMap[sender]` and `lockedMap[recipient]` are checked even if `_inSwap` is true. These checks are unnecessary when `_inSwap` is true.
   - What should I do, step by step, to fix the found gas-wasting patterns? The checks for `lockedMap[sender]` and `lockedMap[recipient]` could be moved inside an else clause for the `if (_inSwap)` conditional. This would mean that the checks are only performed when `_inSwap` is false.
   - On a score of 0 to 5, how would you rate this found new pattern, in terms of how much it is sacrificing readability, security, and maintainability in exchange for gas optimization? Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. This change would not impact readability, security, or maintainability.

1. **Repeated computation of the same expression**

   - How did you find this pattern? The `balanceOf` mapping is accessed multiple times in the `_transferFrom` and `_basicTransfer` functions. Each access to a mapping in Solidity consumes gas, so it's more efficient to minimize these accesses.
   - What should I do, step by step, to fix the found gas-wasting patterns? You could store the result of `balanceOf[sender]` and `balanceOf[recipient]` in local variables in the `_transferFrom` and `_basicTransfer` functions, and then use these local variables instead of accessing the `balanceOf` mapping repeatedly.
   - On a score of 0 to 5, how would you rate this found new pattern, in terms of how much it is sacrificing readability, security, and maintainability in exchange for gas optimization? Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4. This change should not impact security, but it might slightly reduce readability and maintainability because it introduces additional variables.

1. **Extractable code chunks**

   - How did you find this pattern? The `_transferFrom` function contains code to calculate `taxAmount` and update `balanceOf` for `sender`, `lpVault`, and `vault`. This code could be extracted into a separate function.
   - What should I do, step by step, to fix the found gas-wasting patterns? You could create a new function to calculate `taxAmount` and update `balanceOf`. This new function would take `sender`, `amount`, `buyTaxFractional`, and `sellTaxFractional` as arguments, and return `taxAmount`. Then, you would replace the code in `_transferFrom` with a call to this new function.
   - On a score of 0 to 5, how would you rate this found new pattern, in terms of how much it is sacrificing readability, security, and maintainability in exchange for gas optimization? Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. This change should improve readability and maintainability by reducing the length and complexity of the `_transferFrom` function, and it would not impact security.

In terms of improving the prompt, it would be helpful if the prompt provided a brief explanation of the purpose and intended behavior of the contract. This would help us identify any potential trade-offs between gas optimization and the contract's functionality.

Finally, it's worth noting that gas optimization often involves trade-offs with readability and maintainability, and these trade-offs should be carefully considered. In some cases, it might be better to prioritize readability and maintainability over gas optimization, particularly for complex contracts where readability and maintainability can help prevent bugs and security vulnerabilities.
