Sure, let's investigate the provided Solidity code for potential gas-wasting patterns. Your prompt is clear and provides the necessary information for the task.

\section*{Analysis of Provided Solidity Code}

Here are some potential gas-wasting patterns identified in the provided Solidity code:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Multiple Calls to the Same Function}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Discovery Process}: I noticed that there's a call to the function `targetTokenList.length()` twice. The first time is during the execution of the `createSwap` function, and the second time is when we add `tokenKey` to `targetTokenList`. This can be optimized to save gas.
        \item \textit{Fixing Approach}: The length of `targetTokenList` could be stored in a variable at the beginning of the function and then used in the `require` statement. Then, after adding the `tokenKey` to `targetTokenList`, you can increment the stored length by one. This would save the gas used in the second call to `targetTokenList.length()`.
        \item \textit{Impact Score}: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. This change doesn't impact readability, security, or maintainability significantly. It only replaces multiple function calls with a variable.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Multiple Comparisons with Zero}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Discovery Process}: The code checks if `targetToken.originShare` and `targetToken.targetShare` are both greater than zero separately. Combined comparison can be used instead.
        \item \textit{Fixing Approach}: Instead of performing two separate comparisons, we could use a combined comparison to check if `targetToken.originShare` and `targetToken.targetShare` are both greater than zero in one line. This could save a bit of gas as it would remove the need for the `&&` operation.
        \item \textit{Impact Score}: Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. This change might slightly decrease readability as a combined comparison might be slightly less intuitive. However, it doesn't impact security or maintainability.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
```

The analysis and proposed changes aim to slightly reduce the gas cost for executing the `createSwap` function. However, the savings might be insignificant compared to the overall cost. Please also note that these changes should be tested thoroughly to ensure they don't introduce any bugs or security vulnerabilities.

As for the prompt improvement, it would be helpful if you provide the complete contract code so I can better understand the context of each function and variable.
