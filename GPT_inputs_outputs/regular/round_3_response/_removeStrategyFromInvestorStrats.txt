\section*{Analysis of Provided Solidity Code}

\subsection*{New Gas-Wasting Pattern}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Accessing Length Property Multiple Times}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Discovery Process:} In the provided code, it is observed that the `length` property of `investorStrats[depositor]` is being accessed multiple times. In Solidity, accessing the `length` property of an array is not a constant-time operation and can be costly in terms of gas, especially if the array is large.
            \item \textbf{Fixing Approach:} A more gas-efficient approach would be to store the length of `investorStrats[depositor]` in a local variable before the loop and then use this variable inside the loop. This approach reduces the number of costly `length` property accesses. Here is how you can modify the code:
                \begin{verbatim}
                    uint256 stratsLength = investorStrats[depositor].length;
                    if (strategyIndex < stratsLength && 
                        investorStrats[depositor][strategyIndex] == strategy) {
                        investorStrats[depositor][strategyIndex] =
                            investorStrats[depositor][stratsLength - 1];
                    } else {
                        for (uint256 j = 0; j < stratsLength; j++) {
                            if (investorStrats[depositor][j] == strategy) {
                                investorStrats[depositor][j] = 
                                    investorStrats[depositor][stratsLength - 1];
                                break;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                    investorStrats[depositor].pop();
                \end{verbatim}
            \item \textbf{Impact Assessment:} Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4. The proposed modification to the code does not significantly affect its readability or security. It slightly affects maintainability because the developer has to remember to update the local `stratsLength` variable whenever the length of `investorStrats[depositor]` changes.
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Improvements to the Prompt}
The prompt is clear and well-written. However, it could be improved by providing a sample contract that includes state variables and function definitions. This would give a more comprehensive view of the contract's structure and allow for a more detailed analysis of potential gas-wasting patterns.
