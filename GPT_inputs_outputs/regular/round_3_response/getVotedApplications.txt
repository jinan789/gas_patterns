Sure, let's analyze the given Solidity code for potential gas-wasting patterns. 

**Note:** Your prompt is quite precise and detailed, providing enough information to proceed with the analysis. However, a bit more context about the overall function of the contract could help in identifying potential optimizations â€” for example, the relationship between different functions and variables, or how often certain functions are expected to be called.

\section*{Analysis of Provided Solidity Code}

\subsection*{Gas-Wasting Pattern 1: Multiple Storage Reads}

1. **Finding the Pattern:** The code reads from the `applications[_tick]` mapping multiple times inside the loop. Reading from storage is an expensive operation, consuming more gas than reading from memory.

2. **Fixing the Pattern:**
    - Store the `applications[_tick]` into a memory variable before the loop.
    - Replace all instances of `applications[_tick]` inside the loop with the memory variable.

    This works because memory operations are much cheaper than storage operations in terms of gas.

3. **Impact Rating:** 
    - Readability: 5; no significant impact on readability. 
    - Security: 5; no impact on security as the behavior of the function remains the same.
    - Maintainability: 4; a slight decrease as developers need to remember to use the memory variable instead of the storage variable inside the loop.

\subsection*{Gas-Wasting Pattern 2: Unused Computation}

1. **Finding the Pattern:** The code calls the `getVotesByAddress(_tick, _addr)` function and assigns the result to `_votes`, but if `applications[_tick].expireAt == 0`, the loop continues without using `_votes`. This can lead to unnecessary computation and thus wasted gas.

2. **Fixing the Pattern:**
    - Move the computation of `_votes` after the check for `applications[_tick].expireAt == 0`.

    This works because, by doing this, the `getVotesByAddress` function will only be called when its result is actually needed.

3. **Impact Rating:** 
    - Readability: 5; no significant impact on readability. 
    - Security: 5; no impact on security as the behavior of the function remains the same.
    - Maintainability: 5; no impact on maintainability.

\subsection*{Gas-Wasting Pattern 3: Over-allocation of Memory}

1. **Finding the Pattern:** The code allocates memory for several arrays using the length of `tickArray`. However, if there are any elements in `tickArray` for which `applications[_tick].expireAt == 0`, the corresponding slots in the arrays will remain unused. This results in unnecessary memory allocation and gas waste.

2. **Fixing the Pattern:**
    - Instead of pre-allocating memory for all arrays, use dynamic arrays and the `push` function to add elements as needed.
    
    This works because dynamic arrays in Solidity only allocate memory as required, which is more gas-efficient than pre-allocating and potentially wasting memory.

3. **Impact Rating:** 
    - Readability: 4; slight decrease in readability as the use of `push` might be less intuitive than direct indexing.
    - Security: 5; no impact on security as the behavior of the function remains the same.
    - Maintainability: 4; a minor impact as developers need to understand dynamic arrays and the `push` function.

\subsection*{Additional Remark}

While this analysis identifies potential gas-wasting patterns in the provided function, it's important to keep in mind that the best trade-off between gas efficiency and code readability/maintainability may vary depending on the specific use case and requirements of the smart contract in question. It's generally recommended to prioritize readability and maintainability, especially in the context of smart contracts, where bugs and vulnerabilities can have severe financial implications. Gas optimizations should be considered carefully and applied judiciously.
