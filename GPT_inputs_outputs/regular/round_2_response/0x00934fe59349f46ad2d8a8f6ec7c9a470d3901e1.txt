\subsection*{1. Redundant Checks}

\subsubsection*{Pattern Discovery}
The transferFrom function executes checks that the sender and recipient addresses are not zero in the \_approve function and then again in the \_transfer function. This redundancy wastes gas because it unnecessarily executes the same check twice.

\subsubsection*{Solution}
Remove the require statements that check if the 'from' and 'to' addresses are not zero from either the \_approve or \_transfer functions. Here's how to do it:

\begin{verbatim}
    function _approve(
        address owner,
        address spender,
        uint256 amount
    ) private {
        _allowances[owner][spender] = amount;
        emit Approval(owner, spender, amount);
    }
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection*{Sacrifice Score}
- Readability: 5; The code is just as readable without the redundant checks.
- Security: 4; The security is almost unaffected assuming that the checks are still performed elsewhere in the contract.
- Maintainability: 5; The maintainability is not affected because the changes do not make the contract harder to update or modify.

\subsection*{2. Unnecessary Memory Allocation}

\subsubsection*{Pattern Discovery}
In the \_transfer function, a new memory array is created to hold the path for the Uniswap router function call. This is a gas inefficiency because memory is more expensive than storage and this variable is used only once.

\subsubsection*{Solution}
You could hard-code the path into the call to the Uniswap router function. Here's how to do it:

\begin{verbatim}
    uniswapV2Router
        .swapExactTokensForETHSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens(
            tokensToSwap,
            0,
            [address(this), WETH],
            marketingWallet,
            block.timestamp
        );
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection*{Sacrifice Score}
- Readability: 4; The code is slightly less readable because it's less explicit about what the array contains. 
- Security: 5; The security is unaffected.
- Maintainability: 4; The maintainability is slightly decreased because if the path needs to be modified, it has to be done directly in the function call.

\subsection*{3. Redundant Subtraction}

\subsubsection*{Pattern Discovery}
In the transferFrom function, the allowance is decreased by the amount using subtraction. However, this operation is not necessary if the amount is the entire allowance, wasting gas.

\subsubsection*{Solution}
Add an if condition to check whether the amount is equal to the allowance. If it is, then just set the allowance to 0. Here's how to do it:

\begin{verbatim}
    function transferFrom(
        address sender,
        address recipient,
        uint256 amount
    ) public override returns (bool) {
        _transfer(sender, recipient, amount);
        if (_allowances[sender][_msgSender()] == amount) {
            _allowances[sender][_msgSender()] = 0;
        } else {
            _approve(
                sender,
                _msgSender(),
                _allowances[sender][_msgSender()] - amount
            );
        }
        return true;
    }
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection*{Sacrifice Score}
- Readability: 4; The code is slightly less readable because it adds an additional conditional check.
- Security: 5; The security is unaffected.
- Maintainability: 4; The maintainability is slightly decreased because the function now has more logic to manage.
