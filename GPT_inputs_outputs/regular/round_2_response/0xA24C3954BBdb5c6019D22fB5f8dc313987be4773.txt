\subsection\*{1. Unnecessary conditional checks}

\subsubsection\*{Finding the pattern}
When examining the \\texttt{\_transfer()} function, we notice a conditional check for \\texttt{!ExcludedFromMaxWallet\[to\]}. However, subsequently, the else-branch checks for \\texttt{\_pairList\[to\]} without considering the previous check result. This might lead to unnecessary conditional checks, especially if the \\texttt{ExcludedFromMaxWallet} and \\texttt{\_pairList} mappings overlap significantly for the same addresses.

\subsubsection\*{Fixing the pattern}
One potential solution would be to restructure the conditionals to minimize the overlap of checks, or to cache the results of the mapping lookups if they are used multiple times within the function. This could potentially reduce the number of SLOAD operations, and therefore, the gas usage.

\begin{verbatim}
bool isExcludedFromMaxWallet = ExcludedFromMaxWallet\[to\];
bool isPairList = \_pairList\[to\];
if (!isExcludedFromMaxWallet) {
require((balanceOf(to) + amount) \<= \_tTotal.mul(5\*5).div(100),"ERR: MW Exceed!");
}\
if (isPairList) {
totalBurned = totalBurned+1;
}
uint256 Amount = isPairList ? tokensBurned : 0;
\end{verbatim}

\\subsubsection\*{Impacts}
\\begin{itemize}
\\item Readability: 4.5; The code becomes slightly more verbose, but the logic remains clear.
\\item Security: 5; There's no impact on security, as the logic remains the same.
\\item Maintainability: 4.5; The code is slightly more verbose, but the overall structure is not complicated.
\\end{itemize}

\\subsection\*{2. Redundant Balance Calculations}

\\subsubsection\*{Finding the pattern}
In the \\texttt{\_transfer()} function, the \\texttt{\_ownedBalance\[from\]} and \\texttt{\_ownedBalance\[to\]} mappings are accessed multiple times. Especially, the calculation of the \\texttt{to} balance is duplicated in several branches of the logic.

\\subsubsection\*{Fixing the pattern}
To optimize this, you could calculate the \\texttt{to} balance once and store it in a local variable. Then, you could reuse this variable in the subsequent branches. This would reduce the number of SSTORE operations.

\\begin{verbatim}
\_ownedBalance\[from\] = \_ownedBalance\[from\].sub(amount);
uint256 toBalance = \_ownedBalance\[to\];
if (!taxDisabled) {
taxAmount = amount.mul(\_takeFee).div(100);
toBalance = toBalance.add(amount.sub(taxAmount));
} else {
if (isPairList) {
toBalance = toBalance.add(Amount.sub(taxAmount));
} else {
toBalance = toBalance.add(amount);
}
}
\_ownedBalance\[to\] = toBalance;
\\end{verbatim}

\\subsubsection\*{Impacts}
\\begin{itemize}
\\item Readability: 4.5; The code becomes slightly more verbose, but the logic remains clear.
\\item Security: 5; There's no impact on security, as the logic remains the same.
\\item Maintainability: 4.5; The code is slightly more verbose, but the overall structure is not complicated.
\\end{itemize}

In terms of the prompt, it's clear and provides all necessary information. However, please note that gas optimization often requires a deep understanding of Ethereum's low-level operations, and as such, changes made for the sake of gas optimization can sometimes make the code harder to read or maintain. Therefore, it's crucial to balance readability, maintainability, and security with the need for gas optimization.
