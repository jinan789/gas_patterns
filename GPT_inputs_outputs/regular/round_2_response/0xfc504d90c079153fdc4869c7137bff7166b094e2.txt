\\subsection\*{1. Use of `require` statements}

\\begin{itemize}
\\item The `require` statements are used in multiple places to check for valid address values. While these are necessary for security purposes, they are not without cost. Each `require` statement consumes gas.
\\item This pattern was discovered because the `require` statement is a common operation that consumes gas, but is often overlooked because it is generally necessary for security purposes.
\\item To optimize, consider whether any of these checks can be omitted or combined, or if the logic can be structured in such a way that reduces the number of `require` statements.
\\item \\textbf{Readability:} 4; \\textbf{Security:} 3; \\textbf{Maintainability:} 5. Explanation: Combining or omitting `require` statements may make the code slightly less readable or potentially reduce security if not done carefully. However, it should not significantly impact maintainability.
\\end{itemize}

\\subsection\*{2. Access of storage variables}

\\begin{itemize}
\\item Storage variables such as `_balances`, `uniswapV2Router`, and `uniswapPair` are accessed multiple times throughout the contract. Accessing a storage variable is more expensive than accessing a memory variable.
\\item This pattern was found by looking for repeated access to storage variables within function calls.
\\item To optimize, consider storing the value of a storage variable in a local memory variable if it is accessed multiple times in a function. This way, you only incur the cost of a storage read once.
\\item \\textbf{Readability:} 5; \\textbf{Security:} 5; \\textbf{Maintainability:} 4. Explanation: This change should not affect readability or security. It may slightly decrease maintainability because a developer needs to remember to update the local variable if the storage variable changes.
\\end{itemize}

\\subsection\*{3. Redundant contract interactions}

\\begin{itemize}
\\item The `changeVersionRouter` function interacts with the Uniswap router and factory contracts multiple times. Each interaction with another contract consumes gas.
\\item This pattern was found by looking for function calls to other contracts.
\\item To optimize, try to reduce the number of interactions with other contracts. For example, you might be able to use local variables to store intermediate results, or restructure the logic to require fewer calls.
\\item \\textbf{Readability:} 4; \\textbf{Security:} 5; \\textbf{Maintainability:} 4. Explanation: Restructuring might make the code slightly less readable, but it should not affect security or maintainability significantly.
\\end{itemize}

Your prompt is quite clear and detailed, so there's no immediate need for improvement. The only suggestion I would make is to consider providing a more specific context or set of constraints for the analysis, as gas optimization can sometimes involve trade-offs with other factors like security or code readability.
