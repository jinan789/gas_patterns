How did you find this pattern?
Storage variables are frequently used throughout this contract. In Solidity, storage is the most expensive form of state variable in terms of gas costs. It is a persistent form of memory that is quite necessary for contract state, but it should be used judiciously. For instance, in the transferFrom, removeAllFee, and \_transfer functions, the contract state variables such as \_allowances, \_redisFee, \_taxFee, etc., are frequently accessed and updated.

What should I do, step by step, to fix the found gas-wasting patterns?
You should try to minimize the number of storage operations. Consider using local memory variables to hold intermediate calculations, and only update the final result to storage. Also, consider using contract optimization patterns like packing smaller uint values into a single storage slot, if possible.

Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 3.
The use of memory variables for intermediate calculations is a common pattern and should not significantly impact readability or security. However, if storage packing is used, it might make the code harder to maintain due to the need to unpack and pack values.

\subsection{manually found pattern: repeated function calls}
in the \_transfer function, owner() was called multiple times. A better way would be to store it in an intermediate variable.

\subsection*{2. Redundant condition checks}

How did you find this pattern?
In the \_transfer function, there are multiple condition checks that could potentially be optimized or reduced. For example, the condition from != owner() && to != owner() && from != address(this) && to != address(this) could be simplified or restructured for less computation.

What should I do, step by step, to fix the found gas-wasting patterns?
Redundant condition checks should be minimized. Try to restructure your conditions in a way that the most likely scenario is checked first, thus avoiding unnecessary checks. This will require a good understanding of the contract's usage patterns.

Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4.
This is purely a restructuring of the conditions and should not impact the readability, security, or maintainability significantly. It might even make the code easier to read and maintain by reducing complexity.

\subsection*{3. Frequent emission of events}

How did you find this pattern?
Event emission is a common operation in this contract. While necessary for many DApps to track state changes, it does consume gas.

What should I do, step by step, to fix the found gas-wasting patterns?
Consider whether all events are absolutely necessary. If they are, consider whether they can be consolidated or whether the amount of data included can be reduced.

Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4.
Reducing or consolidating events should not impact security. However, it might make the contract slightly harder to maintain and understand, as events often serve as documentation of contract activity.

\subsection*{4. Unnecessary type conversions}

How did you find this pattern?
Type conversions, such as converting an address to a string for emitting in an event, consume more gas than necessary. In the given code, there are frequent conversions to the address type, for example, address(this) and address(uniswapV2Router).

What should I do, step by step, to fix the found gas-wasting patterns?
Try to avoid unnecessary type conversions. If an address is stored in a state variable, there is no need to convert it every time it is used. Store it in its native type and use it directly.

Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5.
Avoiding unnecessary type conversions will not affect the readability, security, or maintainability of the contract. It might even improve readability by reducing clutter.
