Here are some potential gas-wasting patterns I noticed from the provided Solidity code:

1. **Repeated calls to external contract methods**: In the `_accumulateReward` function, `lmPool.lastRewardTimestamp()`, `lmPool.rewardGrowthGlobalX128()`, and `lmPool.lmLiquidity()` are called more than once. Each external contract method call consumes gas, so it's more efficient to store the result in a local variable and refer to that variable instead of making repeated external calls. Also, in the `liquidityToTokenAmounts` and `tokenAmountsToLiquidity` functions, `positionManager.positions(uniV3Nft)` and `pool.slot0()` are called twice. These calls should be reduced to just one by storing their results in a local variable.

    To fix this, introduce local variables to store the results of these methods. For example:
    ```solidity
    uint32 lastRewardTimestamp = lmPool.lastRewardTimestamp();
    uint256 rewardGrowthGlobalX128 = lmPool.rewardGrowthGlobalX128();
    uint256 lmLiquidity = lmPool.lmLiquidity();
    ```
    Then replace all subsequent calls to these methods with the corresponding local variables.

2. **Unnecessary typecasting**: In the `_accumulateReward` function, `endTime` is typecast to `uint32` to create `endTimestamp`, but `endTime` itself is never used again. This is an unnecessary operation and consumes extra gas.

    To fix this, remove the typecasting and use `endTime` directly in the code without converting it to `endTimestamp`.

3. **Redundant conditional branches**: In the function `tokenAmountsToMaximalLiquidity`, there are conditional branches to check the value of `sqrtRatioX96` in relation to `sqrtRatioAX96` and `sqrtRatioBX96`. However, the conditions seem to be overlapping and could possibly be consolidated.

    To fix this, review the logic and consider simplifying the condition branches to eliminate redundancy.

4. **Unoptimized array initialization**: In the `calculateTvlByMinMaxPrices` function, `minTokenAmounts` and `maxTokenAmounts` arrays are initialized with a size of 2 but only the first two elements are used.

    To fix this, consider changing the size of the arrays to match the number of elements that will actually be stored.

5. **Unnecessary calculations**: In the `tokenAmountsToMaximalLiquidity` function, there are calculations performed to determine the liquidity for both tokens, but only the larger value is used.

    To fix this, consider calculating the liquidity for each token in separate conditional branches to avoid unnecessary calculations.

Doing a thorough code review with gas cost optimization in mind is a good practice when writing Solidity contracts. Solidity's unique factor of gas costs for operations makes it important to pay attention to the small details that could end up costing a lot in transaction fees.
