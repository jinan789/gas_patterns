In the provided Solidity code, some gas-optimization improvements can be made. Here are the identified areas:

1. **Usage of `require` for input validation:**

    - **Discovery process:** You're using `require` to validate inputs and conditions, which is a common practice in Solidity. However, `revert` with reasons can consume less gas when the conditions are not met.
    - **Fix:** Replace the `require` statements with `if` conditions and `revert` with reasons. For example, replace `require(_to != address(0), "cannot transfer to address zero");` with:
        ```solidity
        if(_to == address(0)) {
            revert("cannot transfer to address zero");
        }
        ```
    - **Impact:** Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4. The security, readability, and maintainability are not significantly affected by this change.

2. **Redundant checks for address freezing:**

    - **Discovery process:** In the `transferFrom`, `approve`, `increaseApproval`, and `decreaseApproval` functions, you're checking if the `_spender`, `_from`, and `msg.sender` addresses are frozen. In some cases, these validations are redundant.
    - **Fix:** Refactor these functions to only check the necessary address freezing. For example, in the `approve` function, you only need to check if `msg.sender` is frozen.
    - **Impact:** Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. This change improves maintainability by reducing unnecessary code, and readability is slightly affected due to the removal of redundant checks.

3. **Usage of storage instead of memory:**

    - **Discovery process:** In the `decreaseApproval` function, you're declaring `oldValue` as a storage variable. However, storage is much more expensive than memory in terms of gas usage.
    - **Fix:** Declare `oldValue` as a memory variable instead. Replace `uint oldValue = allowed[msg.sender][_spender];` with `uint oldValue = allowed[msg.sender][_spender];`.
    - **Impact:** Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. This change doesn't significantly affect readability, security, or maintainability.

4. **Repeated use of mappings:**

    - **Discovery process:** In your `increaseApproval`, `decreaseApproval`, and `transferFrom` functions, you're repeatedly using `allowed[msg.sender][_spender]`. In Solidity, every access to storage (like mappings) consumes gas.
    - **Fix:** Store `allowed[msg.sender][_spender]` in a local variable and use this instead. For example, in the `increaseApproval` function:
        ```solidity
        uint256 allowance = allowed[msg.sender][_spender];
        allowance = allowance.add(_addedValue);
        allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = allowance;
        ```
    - **Impact:** Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. This change might slightly affect readability but improves maintainability and doesn't affect security.

In terms of the prompt, it's well-formed and clear. It would be helpful to know the version of Solidity being used since some gas-optimization strategies can depend on the version. In my reasoning process, I first looked for common gas-inefficient patterns in Solidity, such as redundant checks and storage usage. Then, I suggested fixes for these patterns and evaluated their impact on readability, security, and maintainability. To improve my reasoning process, I could further consider the specific context and logic of the code to identify more potential gas-inefficient patterns.
