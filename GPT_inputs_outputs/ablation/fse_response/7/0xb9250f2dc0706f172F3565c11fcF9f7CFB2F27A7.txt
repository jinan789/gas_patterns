Here are some gas-wasting patterns I found in the provided Solidity code:

## Pattern 1 - Redundant Storage Lookup

- **Pattern**: Accessing the same state variable multiple times in a single function. For example, in the `addVote` function, the `applications[_tick]` mapping is accessed several times.

- **Discovery Process**: While exploring the code, I noticed that some state variables were being accessed multiple times within the same function. Every time a state variable is accessed, it costs gas, so repeated accesses can be wasteful.

- **Fix**: Store the result in a local variable and use that for subsequent accesses. For instance, in the `addVote` function, we could store `applications[_tick]` in a local variable.

  ````solidity
  IVoteForLaunch.Application storage app = applications[_tick];
  app.totalVotes += _ballots;
  app.topVotes = app.totalVotes;
  ```

- **Why It Works**: This reduces the number of times the expensive storage area is accessed, hence saving gas.

- **Impact Score**: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4. There is no significant impact on readability or security, but maintainability could be slightly impacted if there are many state variables and the function becomes cluttered with local variables.

## Pattern 2 - Repeated External Calls 

- **Pattern**: Repeated calls to external contracts or libraries. For example, in the `newVote` function, `voteToken.allowance()` and `voteToken.balanceOf()` are called twice.

- **Discovery Process**: I noticed that some external functions were being called multiple times, which is expensive in terms of gas.

- **Fix**: Again, store the result in a local variable to avoid redundant calls. For example:

  ````solidity
  uint256 allowance = voteToken.allowance(msg.sender, address(this));
  require(allowance >= newVoteDeposit, "allowance of ferc as deposit not enough");
  require(allowance >= _amount, "allowance is not enough");
  ```

- **Why It Works**: Each external call costs a significant amount of gas. By reducing the number of external calls, we can save gas.

- **Impact Score**: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4. There is no significant impact on readability or security, but maintainability could be slightly impacted if there are many external calls and the function becomes cluttered with local variables.

## Pattern 3 - Unnecessary Storage Writes

- **Pattern**: Writing to storage unnecessarily. For example, in the `newVote` function, the `tickIds[_tick]` mapping is updated every time the function is called, even if the `_tick` already exists in the mapping.

- **Discovery Process**: I noticed that some state variables are always written to, even when it might not be necessary.

- **Fix**: Add a condition to check if the write is necessary. For example:

  ````solidity
  if(tickIds[_tick] == 0) {
      tickArray.push(_tick);
      tickIds[_tick] = tickArray.length;
  }
  ```

- **Why It Works**: Writing to storage is one of the most expensive operations in terms of gas. By reducing unnecessary writes, we can save gas.

- **Impact Score**: Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4. This could slightly reduce readability because the code becomes a bit more complex, but it does not impact security or maintainability significantly.

The given prompt was clear, but it would be helpful to also provide the complete code (including contract state variables and used libraries) for a more accurate analysis. Regarding improvements, I think I could have been quicker in identifying the patterns if I had focused on the most commonly known gas-wasting patterns first.
