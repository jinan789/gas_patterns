Based on the provided Solidity code, here are a few potential gas-wasting patterns:

1. **Redundant External Calls**

- **Pattern Discovery**: The `IPool(ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.getPool())` statement is repeated multiple times in each function. Each instance of this statement is a call to an external contract, which is gas expensive in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
- **Solution**: Instead of calling `IPool(ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.getPool())` each time it is needed, you can call it once at the beginning of the function, assign the result to a local variable, and then reuse that variable in the rest of the function. This way, you only make the external call once, regardless of how many times you use the result. Here's an example of how you can do this:
```solidity
IPool pool = IPool(ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.getPool());
DataTypes.ReserveData memory reserve = pool.getReserveData(asset);
```
- **Evaluation**: This pattern has little to no impact on readability, security, and maintainability of the code. Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5.

2. **Excessive Storage Reads**

- **Pattern Discovery**: The contract reads from the storage multiple times to fetch the same data, specifically when fetching reserve data and token balances. Reading from storage is more expensive than reading from memory.
- **Solution**: You should store these values in memory variables the first time they are fetched, and then use these memory variables throughout the contract. Here's an example:
```solidity
uint256 hTokenBalance = IERC20Detailed(reserve.hTokenAddress).balanceOf(user);
uint256 variableDebtBalance = IERC20Detailed(reserve.variableDebtTokenAddress).balanceOf(user);
uint256 stableDebtBalance = IERC20Detailed(reserve.stableDebtTokenAddress).balanceOf(user);
```
- **Evaluation**: This pattern also has minimal impact on readability, security, and maintainability of the code. Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5.

Regarding your prompt, it is well-written and provides a good level of detail about your requirements. However, it would be helpful to be more specific about what you consider a "new" gas-wasting pattern, as this could be interpreted in different ways. 

In terms of my reasoning process, I first examined the Solidity code to understand what it does, and then looked for patterns that could potentially be gas-inefficient. This involved considering the ways that gas is commonly wasted in Solidity contracts (such as excessive storage operations and redundant external calls) and looking for instances of these patterns in your code. I could potentially improve this process by being more systematic in my examination of the code, perhaps by going through it line by line or function by function.
