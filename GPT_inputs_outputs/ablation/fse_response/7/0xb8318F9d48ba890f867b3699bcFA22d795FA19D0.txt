I have analyzed the provided Solidity code and identified several gas-wasting patterns. Here they are:

1. **Repeated calls to `_gameStatus(game)`.**

    - **How did I find this pattern?** In multiple functions (`openEntries`, `closeEntries`, `cancelGame`, `declareWinner`), `_gameStatus(game)` is called to determine the current status of the game. Each call to `_gameStatus` reads the same variables from storage, which is expensive in terms of gas.
    - **What should I do to fix it?** If possible, consider storing the result of `_gameStatus(game)` in a local variable if it's used more than once within a function. This way, you read from storage once and save on subsequent reads.
    - **Score: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4.** The code is still readable and secure, and the maintainability decreases slightly because you have to ensure the stored value is updated whenever the game status changes.

2. **Storage of boolean variables in the `Game` struct.**

    - **How did I find this pattern?** Each boolean variable in Solidity uses a full storage slot, which can cost a lot of gas. In the `Game` struct, there are five boolean variables.
    - **What should I do to fix it?** Consider packing these boolean variables into a single `uint256` or `uint8`. Each bit in the `uint` represents a boolean variable. This technique is called bit packing and it can save a lot of storage space, hence reducing gas costs.
    - **Score: Readability: 3; Security: 5; Maintainability: 3.** This optimization can make the code less readable because you have to interpret what each bit represents. However, it doesn't affect security and the maintainability only decreases slightly once you get used to the bit operations.

3. **Repeated validation of `onlyAdminOrGameManager`.**

    - **How did I find this pattern?** Several functions (`createGame`, `openEntries`, `closeEntries`, `cancelGame`, `declareWinner`) check the `onlyAdminOrGameManager` modifier. This can waste gas if the same user calls multiple functions in the same transaction.
    - **What should I do to fix it?** Consider creating a function that performs multiple operations in one transaction, checking the `onlyAdminOrGameManager` modifier only once.
    - **Score: Readability: 4; Security: 4; Maintainability: 4.** This change can make some parts of the code less readable as functions become more complex, but overall it doesn't significantly affect readability, security, or maintainability.

For improvements in the prompt:

- The prompt is generally well-written, but it would be helpful to have more information on the context of the code, such as how often certain functions are likely to be called compared to others. This would help prioritize optimizations.

Regarding my reasoning process:

- I started by looking for common gas-wasting patterns in Solidity, such as repeated storage reads and unnecessary storage of variables. Then I looked for places in the code where these patterns might apply.
- To improve, I could have spent more time understanding the business logic of the contract to identify more subtle optimizations. For example, if certain conditions are more likely to be true than others, we could rearrange condition checks to take advantage of short-circuiting and save gas.
