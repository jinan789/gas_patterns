After analyzing the provided Solidity code, I identified the following new gas-wasting patterns:

1. **Repeatedly calling the same function inside a contract**:

    In your code, the function `_etherPrice()` is called multiple times. Each function call requires gas, so repeatedly calling the same function can lead to unnecessary gas expenditure.

    **Solution**: Assign the output of the function to a variable and use it wherever required inside the function scope. 

    **Impact**: 
    * Readability: 5 (No impact on readability)
    * Security: 5 (No impact on security)
    * Maintainability: 5 (No impact on maintainability)

2. **Excessive `require` statements**:

    Several `require` statements are used to validate input parameters. While this is good for security, it tends to consume more gas when the function is called. 

    **Solution**: Combine related `require` statements to minimize the number of them, or use if-else statements where possible.

    **Impact**: 
    * Readability: 3 (It may make the code slightly more difficult to read if conditions are combined)
    * Security: 4 (Slight decrease in security due to less granular error messages)
    * Maintainability: 3 (May make the code slightly harder to maintain if conditions are complex)

3. **Repeated calculation of similar expression**:

    The term `etherAmount * etherPrice` is computed twice in the `liquidation` function and `superLiquidation`, which wastes gas.

    **Solution**: Compute this expression once and store it in a variable to be used later.

    **Impact**: 
    * Readability: 5 (No impact on readability)
    * Security: 5 (No impact on security)
    * Maintainability: 5 (No impact on maintainability)

Regarding your additional requirements:

1. Your prompt is thorough and provides a detailed, well-structured request. The examples of gas-wasting patterns alongside the provided code were very helpful in understanding the task. In the future, it could be beneficial to provide more context about how the contract is used or the specific logic of the contract.

2. I found the patterns by looking for recurring computations and function calls, and also by noting the usage of storage variables. In the future, it would be beneficial to familiarize myself more with common Solidity coding patterns to identify potential inefficiencies more quickly. The improvements I made in the output were to clearly list the new gas-wasting patterns, provide a solution, and rate the impact of the changes to readability, security, and maintainability. This makes it easier for developers to understand the trade-offs involved in optimizing for gas efficiency and to implement the changes if they decide the trade-offs are worth it.
