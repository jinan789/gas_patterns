Sure, I have examined the code and identified several potential gas-wasting patterns:

1. **Constant Functions:** The `verifyInclusion` function is marked as `view`, which means it doesn't modify the state of the contract. However, it contains several `require` statements that could potentially throw errors and consume unnecessary gas if the function is called incorrectly. To fix this, consider using a pattern where the function returns an error code or a tuple with a boolean success indicator and the result, instead of throwing errors for invalid inputs. This can save gas by avoiding unnecessary exceptions.

2. **Excessive External Function Calls:** The `startExitWithDepositedTokens` function makes multiple external calls to other contracts (e.g., `registry.isTokenMappedAndGetPredicate(token)`). Each external call can be expensive in terms of gas. To optimize this, consider minimizing the number of external calls or batch them together if possible. 
    * Readability: 3; Security: 3; Maintainability: 4

3. **Address to Contract Conversion:** Multiple times in the code, there are conversions from `address` to `contract` (e.g., `IPredicate(adjudicatorPredicate).verifyDeprecation(...)`). This can be expensive in terms of gas. If the contract type is known and does not change, use it directly instead of converting from `address`.

4. **Repetitive Gas-Expensive Operations:** The `processExits` function contains a while loop where `exitQueue.currentSize()` is called in each iteration. If this method is gas-expensive, it may cause unnecessary gas consumption. Consider storing the value in a local variable before the loop and update it within the loop if needed.
    * Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4

5. **Non-Effective Send:** In the `processExits` function, the `send` method is called to transfer `BOND_AMOUNT` of Ether. If the `send` fails, it will not throw an error, but will return false. This could allow the contract to continue execution even when the Ether transfer has failed, which is a potential gas waster. Consider using `transfer` instead, which will throw an error if the transfer fails, allowing you to handle this case correctly.
    * Readability: 5; Security: 2; Maintainability: 4

Please note that these are potential gas-wasting patterns, and they may not always lead to higher gas consumption. The actual gas cost will depend on various factors, such as the state of the Ethereum network at the time the transaction is mined, the specific inputs to the function, and the state of the contract at the time the function is called. 

Regarding your additional requirements:

1. Your prompt was clear and provided all necessary information to perform the task. Next time, it would be helpful if you could also provide some additional context about the contract, such as its purpose and expected use cases. This could help to identify more specific optimization opportunities.
2. My reasoning process involved first understanding the purpose and functionality of the contract and its functions, and then systematically going through the code to identify potential gas-wasting patterns. To improve this process, it would be helpful to have a better understanding of the specific context in which the contract is used, as this could help to identify more specific optimization opportunities. For example, if the contract is primarily used for batch processing of transactions, then strategies for optimizing gas usage in batch processing could be applied.
