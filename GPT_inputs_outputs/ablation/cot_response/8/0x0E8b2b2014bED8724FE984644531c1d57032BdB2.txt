From your provided Solidity code, here are some new gas-wasting patterns I identified:

1. **Redundant storage variable loading**: There are redundant loads of `baseData` in both functions. Each `getReserveData` call fetches a `DataTypes.ReserveData` struct from storage, but this struct is loaded each time in the loop, although it is not changing during the loop's execution. This is a wasteful operation and can be optimized by loading it only once.
   - **Solution**: Move the `getReserveData` call outside of the loop and store the result in a local variable.
   - **Impact on readability, security, and maintainability**: 
     - Readability: 5
     - Security: 5
     - Maintainability: 5

2. **Repeated contract interface casting**: The contract interface `DefaultReserveInterestRateStrategy` is cast multiple times to call different methods. Every time you cast the contract interface, it consumes a little bit of gas.
    - **Solution**: You should cast it once and store the result in a local variable, then reuse that variable.
    - **Impact on readability, security, and maintainability**: 
      - Readability: 4 (because the variable will be used in multiple places)
      - Security: 5
      - Maintainability: 5

3. **Multiple external calls to the same contract**: The contract `DefaultReserveInterestRateStrategy` is called multiple times in the method `getReservesData`. Each external call to a contract method consumes more gas than an internal call or a local computation.
    - **Solution**: If possible, refactor the `DefaultReserveInterestRateStrategy` contract to provide a single method that returns all required data in one call. This requires changes not only in the current contract, but also in the `DefaultReserveInterestRateStrategy` contract, which might not always be feasible.
    - **Impact on readability, security, and maintainability**: 
      - Readability: 2 (as the single method might return many variables)
      - Security: 4 (provided the new method is implemented correctly)
      - Maintainability: 3 (as changes in one contract would require changes in the other)

4. **Unnecessary computations in a try-catch block**: The contract `DefaultReserveInterestRateStrategy` is called in a try-catch block which will consume extra gas even when the call does not fail.
    - **Solution**: Remove the unnecessary try-catch if you are sure that the call will not fail. If not, you can still leave it but be aware that it will consume extra gas.
    - **Impact on readability, security, and maintainability**: 
      - Readability: 5
      - Security: 4 (depends on the certainty that the call will not fail)
      - Maintainability: 5

In terms of improving the prompt, it would be helpful to provide a brief description of the purpose of the contract and its methods, as well as a description of the custom types and interfaces used. This would help better understand the context of the code and potentially identify more patterns.

For reasoning, it is important to have a solid understanding of how Ethereum gas works and to be able to identify common patterns that are high in gas cost. Also, knowing the context and purpose of the code can help identify unnecessary computations or redundant calls. Finally, understanding the interfaces and custom types used can also be beneficial in identifying potential optimization areas.
