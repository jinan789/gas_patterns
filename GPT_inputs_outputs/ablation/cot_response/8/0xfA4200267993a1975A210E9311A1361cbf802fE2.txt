In reviewing the Solidity code you provided, I found a few patterns that might contribute to gas inefficiency. Here are my findings:

1. **Excessive use of `require` statements**: In the `createStream` function, there are many `require` statements to validate the inputs. While these are necessary for security, it's worth noting that each `require` statement consumes gas. A potential optimization could be to group similar `require` statements together, or use external libraries like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath library to handle checks automatically.
    * How to find and fix: Review the code for `require` statements and evaluate if any can be combined or eliminated. Remember, security should always be prioritized over gas optimization.
    * Impact: Readability: 4; Security: 3; Maintainability: 4

2. **Repeated access to storage**: In the `getStream` and `balanceOf` functions, the code fetches the `Stream` object from the `_streams` mapping multiple times. As storage is expensive in terms of gas, this is inefficient. A solution is to fetch the `Stream` object once and store it in a local `memory` variable for subsequent use.
    * How to find and fix: Look for repeated access to storage variables. Replace with a single fetch into a local `memory` variable.
    * Impact: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5

3. **Excessive use of temporary variables**: In the `createStream` function, there's a use of temporary variables `vars.duration` and `vars.ratePerSecond` that could be simplified or removed to save gas.
    * How to find and fix: Look for temporary variables and evaluate if they can be eliminated or simplified.
    * Impact: Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4

4. **Excessive condition checks**: In the `balanceOf` function, the code checks if `who` is the `stream.recipient` or the `stream.sender` and returns different balances accordingly. However, if the `who` is neither the `stream.recipient` nor the `stream.sender`, it returns `0` which might be an unnecessary check and gas-consuming.
    * How to find and fix: Review the conditions where the code checks multiple conditions and evaluate if they can be optimized.
    * Impact: Readability: 4; Security: 4; Maintainability: 4

5. **Repeated function calls**: In the `balanceOf` function, it calls `deltaOf(streamId)` which then fetches the `Stream` object from the `_streams` mapping again. This repeated function call and storage access can be gas-consuming.
    * How to find and fix: Look for repeated function calls and evaluate if they can be replaced by single fetch and store in local variable.
    * Impact: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5

To improve on this task in the future, it's important to have a deep understanding of how Ethereum works particularly in relation to gas computation. A solid understanding of Solidity and common coding patterns is also essential. Lastly, using tools like gas profilers and solhint can help identify potential areas of inefficiency. 

As for the prompt, it was clear and well-written. However, it might be beneficial to provide a specific range or goal for gas optimization, as optimizing for gas can sometimes lead to less readable or maintainable code, and it's important to strike the right balance.
