Let's examine the given Solidity code and try to identify potential gas-wasting patterns beyond the ones you've already listed. Here are a couple of patterns I found:

9. **Repeated Contract Deployment**
    - This pattern occurs when a new contract instance is created each time a function is called. The `addFarm` function in the provided code deploys a new `farmingToken` contract each time it's called, if `isUsingToken` is true. Contract deployment is a gas-intensive operation, and this could be a significant waste of gas if the same contract is being deployed repeatedly with no substantial variations.
    - To fix this, consider using a factory pattern or singleton pattern where you only deploy the contract once and reuse it, or emit event logs to keep track of different states of the contract. This would largely depend on the logic of the contract and whether it's safe to reuse contract instances.
    - Readability: 3; Security: 4; Maintainability: 2

10. **Multiple State Variable Updates In A Single Transaction**
    - In the `addFarm` function, the `farm` struct is updated multiple times within the same transaction. Each state variable update consumes gas. The EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) charges for every SSTORE operation (storage update). So, it would be more gas efficient to combine these updates into a single state update.
    - To fix this, you could create a local copy of the struct, perform all the updates on the local copy, and then update the storage variable once at the end of the function.
    - Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 3 

11. **Excessive Checks In Function Calls**
    - In the provided code, there are several functions that include checks to ensure the farm ID is valid (`if (fId >= farmCount) revert InvalidFarm();`). These checks can consume gas especially if they're performed frequently.
    - To fix this, consider using a modifier that performs this check once. Alternatively, if safety allows, consider removing or reducing these checks, especially if they are redundant.
    - Readability: 5; Security: 3; Maintainability: 4

As for your prompt, it would be helpful if you provided more context for the functions in the contract. For instance, explaining the purpose and expected behavior of each function could help in identifying more potential gas-wasting patterns. Also, it would be helpful to know more about the contract's expected usage patterns (e.g., how frequently different functions are expected to be called).

In terms of the reasoning process, it is essential to understand the contract's logic and the Solidity language's gas usage patterns. Reviewing the Solidity documentation and various resources on Ethereum gas optimization is crucial. However, it's also important to strike a balance between gas optimization and code maintainability, readability, and security, as extreme gas optimization could adversely affect these aspects.
