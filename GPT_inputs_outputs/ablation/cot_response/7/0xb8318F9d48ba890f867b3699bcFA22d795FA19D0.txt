Sure, let's analyze the provided Solidity code to identify potential new patterns that may waste gas.

1. **Gas-Wasting Pattern: Redundant Storage Reads**

    *Explanation*: In the functions `openEntries`, `closeEntries`, `cancelGame`, and `declareWinner`, the function `_gameStatus(game)` is called twice. Each of these calls result in multiple reads from storage. The result of the first call is stored in `gameStatus__`, but this stored value is not used in the following logic, resulting in the second, redundant call to `_gameStatus(game)`. 

    *Solution*: To reduce the gas cost, we can reuse the `gameStatus__` variable in the subsequent logic instead of calling `_gameStatus(game)` again.

    *Impact*: 
        * Readability: 5 (No change as we are just reusing a variable)
        * Security: 5 (No change in security as the result of the function call is deterministic)
        * Maintainability: 5 (Easier to maintain as we are reducing redundant operations)

2. **Gas-Wasting Pattern: Redundant Condition Check**

    *Explanation*: In the `declareWinner` function, there is a condition check `if (gameStatus__ != GameStatus.EntriesClosed)`. This is redundant because the same check has been performed in the `checkGameId(gameId_)` modifier.

    *Solution*: Remove the redundant condition check in the `declareWinner` function.

    *Impact*: 
        * Readability: 5 (The redundancy removal does not affect readability)
        * Security: 5 (Removing the redundancy does not compromise security)
        * Maintainability: 5 (The code becomes easier to maintain by removing the redundant checks)

3. **Gas-Wasting Pattern: Inefficient Variables Initialization**

    *Explanation*: In the `createGame` function, the variable `uint256 options_ = odds_.length;` is declared and then used only in two places. While this doesn't lead to a drastic increase in gas usage, it is not optimally efficient.

    *Solution*: Instead of storing `odds_.length` in a variable, use `odds_.length` directly in the conditions.

    *Impact*: 
        * Readability: 4 (The change does not significantly affect readability, but the code may be slightly less readable to some due to the removal of the descriptive variable name)
        * Security: 5 (No impact on security)
        * Maintainability: 5 (The code remains maintainable)

Regarding your additional requirements:

1. The provided prompt is quite clear and descriptive, providing enough information to answer your questions. However, it would be beneficial to provide more examples of 'gas-wasting' patterns in Solidity for more accurate analysis.

2. My reasoning process involved going through the provided code line by line, understanding the functionality, and comparing it with the existing list of gas-wasting patterns. I focused on repeated operations, redundant computations, and inefficient storage usage, which are common gas-wasting patterns. To improve next time, I could go deeper into the Solidity language's peculiarities, such as function modifiers and delegate calls, to identify more subtle gas-wasting patterns. I believe my output here is accurate given the current scope of the task.
