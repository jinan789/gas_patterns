Analyzing the provided Solidity code, here are some potential gas-wasting patterns beyond the ones mentioned in the initial list:

1. **Calling external contract's methods multiple times:** The code calls `voteToken.allowance(msg.sender, address(this))` and `voteToken.balanceOf(msg.sender)` twice in the `newVote` and `deposit` functions. Every external contract call consumes more gas than local operations, so it's a waste to call them more than necessary.

   - How did you find this pattern and what should I do to fix it?  
   I noticed that the same external contract method is called multiple times within the same transaction. To fix this, store the result of the first call in a local variable and use that in the subsequent checks.

   - Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. Storing the result in a local variable doesn't sacrifice readability, security, or maintainability. 

2. **Repeated computation of timestamp:** The code calculates `block.timestamp + _expireSeconds` twice in the `newVote` function. 

   - How did you find this pattern and what should I do to fix it?
   I noticed that the same timestamp calculation is performed twice within the same function. To optimize this, you could calculate it once at the beginning and store the result in a local variable, then use this variable later in the code. 

   - Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. Storing the result in a local variable doesn't sacrifice readability, security, or maintainability.

3. **Inefficient storage updates:** In the `withdrawNewVote` function, the `applications[_tick].deposit` is updated twice. First, it's fetched into memory and then updated to zero in storage. 

   - How did you find this pattern and what should I do to fix it?
   I noticed that a storage variable is fetched into memory and then updated in storage. As storage operations are costly, it would be more gas-efficient to directly update the storage variable without fetching it into memory. 

   - Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4. Directly updating the storage variable could be less intuitive for programmers accustomed to first retrieving the value, but it doesn't compromise security or significantly impact maintainability.

4. **Underutilized return values:** In the `newVote` function, `TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom` is called but its return value is not checked. If this function fails, the contract will continue executing, potentially leading to incorrect state.

   - How did you find this pattern and what should I do to fix it?
   I noticed that the return value of an external function call is not checked. One way to fix this issue would be to require that the `safeTransferFrom` function returns `true`, halting execution of the contract if it does not. 

   - Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4. Adding an extra requirement statement may slightly decrease readability and maintainability, but it significantly improves the security of the contract.

Overall, your prompt was clear and comprehensive, but it would be helpful to provide a brief explanation or example of the Solidity contract's functionality to give context to the code. 

During the analysis of the code, I kept the gas-wasting patterns you provided in mind, while also considering general best practices for Solidity programming. I think I could improve next time by having a more systematic approach to scanning through the code and identifying potential inefficiencies, such as creating a checklist of common gas-wasting patterns and ticking them off as I go.
