In the provided Solidity code, you can find several gas-wasting patterns. Below are a few of these patterns along with suggestions on how to fix them:

**1. Inefficient Loops**
- *Pattern*: The nested loop in the `openLottery` function, where it checks if a ticket ID is a duplicate, is inefficient and may lead to high gas consumption. The efficiency of this code decreases as the `WIN_COUNT` increases.
- *Fix*: Instead of iterating over the entire array of `winTicketIdsTmp` every time to check for duplicates, you can use a mapping to check if a ticket ID has already been drawn. This way, the look-up time is constant and does not depend on the size of `winTicketIdsTmp`.
- *Impacts*: Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4

**2. Frequent Storage Writes**
- *Pattern*: In the `openLottery` function, the `cycle_.winner.push(...)` operation is a storage write operation that is executed inside a loop. Storage is expensive in Ethereum, and thus writing to storage inside loops should be avoided.
- *Fix*: Accumulate the winners in memory and then write to storage in one go after the loop. This way, you limit the storage write operations to a single instance, which can save a lot of gas.
- *Impacts*: Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4

**3. Unnecessary Condition Checks**
- *Pattern*: In the `_transferFrom` function, the code checks `if (buyTaxFractional > 0)` and `if (sellTaxFractional > 0)`. If these values are non-zero by default and are only updated in the `setTaxBuyAndSellFractional` function (which seems to be only accessible by the contract owner), these condition checks can be considered unnecessary.
- *Fix*: Remove these unnecessary condition checks. If these values could be zero, consider setting them to a non-zero value during contract initialization and updating them only when necessary.
- *Impacts*: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5

**4. Redundant Checks in Function Modifiers**
- *Pattern*: The `onlyOwner` modifier is used frequently, which checks if the `msg.sender` is the owner of the contract. This is a necessary check, but if a function already has this modifier, then there's no need to check the owner again within the function.
- *Fix*: Avoid using redundant owner checks in the functions that already use the `onlyOwner` modifier.
- *Impacts*: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5

The task is clear, but it would be more beneficial if you provide a bit more context about the contract, like the purpose of the contract and the relationships between different functions. This would help in understanding the contract as a whole and identifying gas-wasting patterns more efficiently.

As for the reasoning process, it's important to understand the contract's logic thoroughly before identifying gas-wasting patterns. This is because what may seem like an inefficiency might actually be a necessary part of the contract's logic. So, reading the contract code multiple times and understanding each function's role is crucial. It would also be beneficial to have a good understanding of how gas is calculated in Ethereum, as this is fundamental to identifying gas-wasting patterns. 

To improve next time, I could focus more on understanding the contract's overall logic before diving into the details of each function. This would give me a better idea of where to look for potential gas-wasting patterns. Also, keeping up-to-date with the latest best practices and techniques for gas optimization in Solidity could help in identifying more complex gas-wasting patterns.
