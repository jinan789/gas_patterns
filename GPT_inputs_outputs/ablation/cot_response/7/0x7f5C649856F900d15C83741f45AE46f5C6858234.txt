After reviewing the provided Solidity code, I identified some additional gas-wasting patterns. These patterns are:

1. **Repeated External Calls:** The code performs multiple external calls to functions of the same external contract instance. For instance, in the `_convertPositionToFullRange` function, there are multiple calls to `_nftPositionManager` methods. Each external call in Solidity costs gas, and the costs can add up quickly with repeated calls.

   * **Solution:** To fix this, you could bundle these operations into a single function (if you have control over the external contract), or batch the operations where possible. 

   * **Readability: 4; Security: 4; Maintainability: 3**

2. **Duplicate Contract Address References:** This code frequently references the address of `this` contract, which costs gas each time.

   * **Solution:** You could store `address(this)` in a state variable at the time of contract deployment and use that variable instead of `address(this)`.

   * **Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4**

3. **Repetitive Keccak256 Hashing:** In the `addOrEditFee` method, the same `_name` input is hashed twice. This is an unnecessary duplication of effort and gas.

   * **Solution:** You could store the result of the hash in a local variable and reuse it.

   * **Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5**

Please note that while gas optimization is important, it's also crucial not to sacrifice code readability and maintainability excessively. The balance between these factors could vary depending on the specific use case of your contract.

As for your additional requirements:

1. Your prompt was clear and provided a good amount of context for the task. One suggestion might be to provide specific examples of the gas-wasting patterns you have already mentioned for better clarity.
   
2. In terms of my reasoning process, I started by looking at the known gas-wasting patterns and tried to apply them to your code. I also looked for any operations that might be particularly expensive in terms of gas, such as external contract calls and hash calculations. I believe this approach was effective in identifying potential gas-wasting patterns. In the future, I could also consider additional factors, such as the specific gas costs of different operations and the frequency of function calls, to further refine the analysis.
