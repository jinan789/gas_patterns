Based on your code, I found a few new gas-wasting patterns that are not on your provided list:

1. **Unnecessary string conversion**: In the `donateERC20` function, `string calldata symbol = _tokenSymbol;` is declared and used, but `_tokenSymbol` is already a string type, so this conversion appears to be unnecessary. If this is done for readability purposes, a comment could be used instead to clarify the purpose of `_tokenSymbol`.

   - **How to fix**: Remove unnecessary type conversions.
   - **Readability**: 5, **Security**: 5, **Maintainability**: 5 

2. **Redundant variable declaration**: In the `donateERC20` function, there are several redundant declarations of variables that simply copy the function parameters. This includes `string calldata symbol = _tokenSymbol;`, `bytes calldata message = _message;`, `address token = _token;`, `bytes32[] calldata merkleProof = _merkleProof;`, and `uint256 amountInDesired = _amountInDesired;`. This is unnecessary and consumes extra gas.

   - **How to fix**: Use function parameters directly instead of creating new variables.
   - **Readability**: 5, **Security**: 5, **Maintainability**: 5 

3. **Repeated contract interaction**: In the `_transferToken` function, `IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));` is called twice, which can be expensive in terms of gas. 

   - **How to fix**: Assign the result of the first call to a variable and reuse it.
   - **Readability**: 5, **Security**: 5, **Maintainability**: 5 

4. **Unnecessary use of assembly**: In the `stringToBytes32` function, assembly is used to perform a conversion. However, this can be done in Solidity without using assembly, which is safer and less gas-consuming.

   - **How to fix**: Replace assembly with Solidity code.
   - **Readability**: 2, **Security**: 4, **Maintainability**: 2 

5. **Unnecessary balance check**: In the `withDrawToken` function, `require(amount > 0 && amount <= to.balance, "Invalid input amount.");` is used to check the balance of `to`. But this check is unnecessary because if the contract doesn't have enough balance, the transaction will fail anyway.

   - **How to fix**: Remove unnecessary balance checks.
   - **Readability**: 5, **Security**: 5, **Maintainability**: 5 


For your prompt, it would be helpful if you could provide a list of all the contract's state variables, as the gas optimization could also depend on how these variables are defined and used. 

As for the reasoning process, it mainly involved understanding the Solidity code and identifying any operations or constructs that are known to consume relatively more gas. To improve, it would be helpful to have a more detailed understanding of the contract's business logic and how it interacts with external contracts or addresses. This could help identify more nuanced gas-wasting patterns. 

For this task, I have focused on identifying gas-wasting patterns related to unnecessary or redundant operations, as these are generally easier to spot and fix without affecting the contract's functionality. In the future, a more in-depth analysis could involve considering alternative ways to implement the same functionality that are more gas-efficient.
