Sure, here are some additional gas-wasting patterns in Solidity. 

1. **Unoptimized array operations:**  Operating on arrays in Solidity could be expensive in terms of gas. For instance, removing an element from an array will require shifting all elements in the array, which is an O(n) operation. This becomes expensive as the array grows.
    - *How to find this pattern:* Look for array operations that could be optimized. For example, if you spot a delete operation on an array, that's a potential gas waster.
    - *How to fix:* To fix this, you might want to use data structures that are more efficient. For example, use a mapping (hash table) instead of an array for storing data if you're doing a lot of deletes.
    - *Impact on Readability, Security, and Maintainability:* Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 3. Using a mapping might be less intuitive than an array, but it doesn't compromise security. However, it might make the code slightly harder to maintain because developers must remember to manage keys in the mapping.

2. **Repetitive string operations:** String operations in Solidity are expensive. If you're performing the same string operation multiple times, you're wasting gas.
    - *How to find this pattern:* Look for repeated string operations. This could be string concatenation, substring, or comparison.
    - *How to fix:* To fix this, you might want to avoid unnecessary string operations. For example, you can store the result of a string operation in a variable and reuse it instead of performing the operation again.
    - *Impact on Readability, Security, and Maintainability:* Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. Storing the result of a string operation in a variable doesn't compromise readability, security, or maintainability.

3. **Excessive use of fallback function:** The fallback function is called when a contract is called with no function specified or if the function does not exist. Having complex logic in the fallback function can consume more gas.
    - *How to find this pattern:* Look for logic in the fallback function that could be moved to a regular function.
    - *How to fix:* To fix this, you should consider moving logic out of the fallback function and into regular functions. This way, callers can specify the function they want to call, and the fallback function can remain simple and cheap.
    - *Impact on Readability, Security, and Maintainability:* Readability: 5; Security: 4; Maintainability: 5. Moving logic out of the fallback function can make the code easier to read and maintain, but care must be taken to ensure that the new functions are secure.

4. **Unoptimized use of Events:** Events are used in Solidity for logging and watching for changes. If you're emitting events with large amounts of data or emitting events unnecessarily, you're wasting gas.
    - *How to find this pattern:* Look for events that are emitting large amounts of data or events that are being emitted but not used.
    - *How to fix:* To fix this, consider reducing the amount of data emitted in events or removing unused events.
    - *Impact on Readability, Security, and Maintainability:* Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. Reducing the amount of data in events or removing unused events does not impact readability, security, or maintainability.

For your additional requirements:

1. The prompt is clear and provides a good foundation for the task. However, it would be helpful to provide a bit more context about the specific Solidity version or environment in which these gas-wasting patterns might occur.
2. In terms of improving the reasoning process, it might be beneficial to consider the context in which the Solidity code is running. For example, if the contract is running on a network where gas prices are low or not a concern, then some of these optimizations might not be necessary. The focus should always be on writing clean, secure, and maintainable code while being aware of potential gas costs.
