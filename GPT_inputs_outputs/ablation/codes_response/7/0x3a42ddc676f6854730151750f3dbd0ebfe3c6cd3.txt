Sure, I understand your request. We'll be looking for new patterns in Solidity code that can potentially waste gas, and then provide solutions to mitigate the wastage.

1. **Inefficient use of data types:** Solidity has several data types and using a larger data type than necessary can waste gas. For example, using `uint256` for a variable that will never exceed the value of 255 wastes additional storage.
    - Discovery: This pattern was found by examining the Solidity data types and their respective sizes. It's known that larger data types require more gas to store and manage. So, if a programmer uses a larger data type than necessary, this could waste gas.
    - Fix: Use the smallest data type that can accommodate your data. For example, if a variable will never exceed the value of 255, use `uint8` instead of `uint256`.
    - Impact: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 3. The change won't affect readability or security, but developers need to ensure the chosen data type suits future use-cases.

2. **Unoptimized array operations:** Numerous operations on arrays can be gas-intensive. For instance, searching an unsorted array for a particular value requires a linear search which is O(n). 
    - Discovery: This pattern was found by considering the computational complexity of array operations. Linear searches are inefficient, and doing this multiple times can waste gas.
    - Fix: Use a mapping for constant-time lookups if possible. If you need to use an array, consider keeping it sorted so you can use binary search for faster lookups.
    - Impact: Readability: 2; Security: 5; Maintainability: 3. Using mappings or sorted arrays could make code less readable but doesn't affect security. Maintenance could be trickier as developers need to manage data structure state.

3. **Unnecessary function visibility:** Functions in Solidity can be public, private, internal, or external. Public and external functions can be called from outside the contract and require more gas than internal or private functions.
    - Discovery: This pattern was found by understanding how function visibility affects gas usage. Public and external functions have a higher gas cost because they require additional computation to verify call permissions.
    - Fix: Limit function visibility as much as possible. If a function doesn't need to be called externally, make it private or internal.
    - Impact: Readability: 5; Security: 4; Maintainability: 4. Reducing function visibility won't affect readability, but care must be taken to not compromise security or future updates.

4. **Not utilizing short-circuiting in boolean operations:** In boolean operations, if the result can be determined by evaluating the leftmost expression only, the remaining expressions are not evaluated. This is known as short-circuiting.
    - Discovery: This pattern was found by understanding how boolean operations are evaluated in Solidity. If the more likely condition is placed last, this could lead to unnecessary computation and waste gas.
    - Fix: Order your boolean expressions wisely. Place the conditions that are more likely to be true at the beginning to take advantage of short-circuiting.
    - Impact: Readability: 3; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4. This may slightly affect readability as the order of conditions may not follow the logical flow of the program. 

Regarding your additional requirements, your prompt is clear and well-structured. However, you could mention the level of expertise you expect in Solidity as this can influence the complexity of the patterns to be identified. 

Reflecting on my reasoning process, I leveraged my understanding of Solidity's gas pricing and its programming constructs to identify potential wastage patterns. The key here is to understand how different operations and constructs in Solidity are priced in terms of gas, and then look for situations where these are not used optimally. This might require deep knowledge of the language and the EVM, and to improve the task completion next time, keeping up-to-date with the latest changes and optimizations in the language and EVM would be beneficial.
