Here are a few additional gas-wasting patterns that I identified:

1. **Unoptimized arithmetic operations:** Often, programmers might use multiplication or division where they could use a shift left or shift right operation. Shifting bits is significantly more efficient in terms of gas usage.

    - *Discovery Process:* This pattern was found by understanding the cost of various operations in the EVM. Bitwise operations are known to be less expensive than arithmetic ones. Many programmers coming from a high-level programming background may not be aware of this as modern compilers usually optimize these operations.
    - *Fix Steps:* If you spot multiplication or division by powers of 2, replace them with left shift or right shift respectively. For example, `x * 2` can be replaced with `x << 1` and `x / 2` can be replaced with `x >> 1`.
    - *Impact:* Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4. This change might slightly reduce readability for those unfamiliar with bitwise operations, but it doesn't impact security and has little effect on maintainability.

2. **Excessive event logging:** Event logs are useful for applications to track contract state changes, but they cost gas. Emitting unnecessary events can be a waste.

    - *Discovery Process:* This pattern was found by assessing the use of event logs in contracts. While logs are crucial for DApp interaction, they do have a cost and unnecessary logging can increase the gas usage
    - *Fix Steps:* Review event logs and remove any unnecessary ones. Also, consider batching multiple logs into a single event where possible.
    - *Impact:* Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 3. Removing excessive event logs doesn't impact readability or security, but it might affect maintainability if logs are being used for debugging or tracking state changes.

3. **Unoptimized array operations:** Looping through arrays, especially large or dynamically sized ones, can consume significant amounts of gas. 

    - *Discovery Process:* This pattern was found by understanding that storage operations in Solidity are expensive. Iterating through arrays can result in numerous storage reads, which increase the gas cost.
    - *Fix Steps:* Consider using mappings instead of arrays where possible, as mappings do not require iteration for access. If you must use an array, try to limit the size or avoid full array scans.
    - *Impact:* Readability: 3; Security: 4; Maintainability: 3. This change might decrease readability and maintainability due to the different usage patterns of mappings compared to arrays, but it typically doesn't impact security.

4. **Using `send` or `transfer` instead of `call`:** While `send` and `transfer` are safer as they limit gas sent to prevent reentrancy attacks, they are also more expensive in terms of gas.

    - *Discovery Process:* This pattern was found by understanding the different ways to send Ether in Solidity. While `send` and `transfer` are safer, they are also more gas-intensive.
    - *Fix Steps:* Consider using a pattern like the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to prevent reentrancy attacks while using `call` instead of `send` or `transfer` for sending Ether.
    - *Impact:* Readability: 4; Security: 3; Maintainability: 4. This might slightly decrease readability and security as proper use of `call` requires more careful programming, but it should not significantly impact maintainability.

For future tasks, I would appreciate it if you could clarify if there are specific areas or types of gas wastage you are interested in. This would help me focus my analysis and provide more targeted suggestions.

As for the reasoning process, it's essential to have a deep understanding of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Solidity language semantics. By knowing what operations are costly in terms of gas, we can identify potential wastage areas. It's also beneficial to regularly review and update your knowledge of the EVM and Solidity as optimizations and best practices can change with new versions and updates.
