Here are a few additional gas-wasting patterns in Solidity:

1. **Non-optimal data types:** Using larger data types than necessary can lead to wastage of gas because larger data types take up more storage space. For instance, if a variable only needs to store values between 1 and 10, using a `uint256` instead of a `uint8` would be a waste of gas.

    - Discovery: This pattern was identified by examining the storage costs associated with different data types in Solidity. The larger the data type, the more storage space it requires, and therefore the more gas it consumes.
    - Fix: Step by step, to fix this pattern, one should first identify variables that are using larger data types than necessary. Then, refactor the code to use the smallest data type that can accommodate all possible values of the variable.
    - Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4. Using smaller data types can make the code more efficient without sacrificing readability or security, but it might slightly impact maintainability because programmers need to be mindful of the range of values each variable can hold.

2. **Unnecessary array length declarations:** Declaring the length of dynamic arrays when it's not needed can waste gas because the operation of setting the length of an array is costly.

    - Discovery: This pattern was identified by understanding the workings of arrays in Solidity. The operation of setting the length of an array requires updating the storage, which is expensive in terms of gas.
    - Fix: Instead of explicitly declaring the length of dynamic arrays, use the `push()` function to add elements to the array. This function automatically increases the length of the array as needed.
    - Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. Using the `push()` function instead of setting the length of arrays does not impact readability, security, or maintainability.

3. **Using `address.call()` instead of `address.transfer()` or `address.send()`:** The `.call()` function is much more expensive in terms of gas because it allows arbitrary function calls, while `.transfer()` and `.send()` only allow for sending Ether.

    - Discovery: This pattern was identified by comparing the gas costs of different functions for sending Ether in Solidity. The `address.call()` function is more expensive because it's more powerful and flexible, but this flexibility is often unnecessary.
    - Fix: Whenever possible, use `address.transfer()` or `address.send()` to send Ether instead of `address.call()`. These functions are cheaper in terms of gas and also safer because they don't allow for arbitrary function calls.
    - Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 5. Replacing `address.call()` with `address.transfer()` or `address.send()` does not negatively impact readability, security, or maintainability.

Please remember that while it's important to optimize for gas, it's also crucial not to sacrifice security, readability, and maintainability in the process. In some cases, it might be worth spending a bit more gas to ensure that the contract is secure, easy to read, and easy to maintain.

As for the improvement, your prompt was clear and concise. However, it would be helpful to specify whether the gas-wasting patterns should be relevant to a specific version of Solidity or any version in general. Solidity is being updated regularly and some gas-wasting patterns might not be applicable to all versions.

In terms of my reasoning process, I found it helpful to think about how different operations in Solidity translate to low-level EVM operations, which have specific gas costs associated with them. By understanding these low-level operations, I was able to identify patterns that would lead to unnecessary gas usage. However, I could improve by keeping up-to-date with the latest versions of Solidity and the changes made to the gas costs of different operations. This could help me identify new gas-wasting patterns that might emerge as the language evolves.
