Sure, I understand your request and here are some potential new gas-wasting patterns in Solidity:

1. **Unoptimized array usage:** Solidity arrays, especially dynamic ones, require more gas for access and modification than mappings or individual variables. If arrays are used in a manner where the order of elements is not important, it might waste extra gas.

    - Discovery: This pattern is found by observing that arrays, especially when they are large, can consume more gas due to the linear time complexity of many operations (like finding or deleting an element). It's common for developers coming from other programming languages to overuse arrays as they are a basic and intuitive data structure.
    - Fix: Consider using mappings where the order of elements is not important. If order matters, consider using a data structure like a linked list. Also, if you are dealing with a fixed-size array, try to use 'bytes1', 'bytes2', ..., 'bytes32' instead of 'bytes' or 'string' as they are cheaper.
    - Impact: Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 3. This change could potentially make the code slightly less readable, as arrays are a common structure that many developers understand. However, it should not impact security, and while it may make certain operations more complex, it could improve the efficiency and thus maintainability of the code.

2. **Excessive event logging:** Events in Solidity are a way of storing logs, which can be helpful for debugging or tracking contract activity. However, every event logged consumes gas, and excessive or unnecessary logging can waste gas.

    - Discovery: This pattern is found by recognizing that event logging, while useful for certain applications, is not free in terms of gas consumption. Overuse of events, particularly within complex functions or loops, can quickly increase gas costs.
    - Fix: Limit the usage of events to only those necessary for the functioning of the contract or critical for tracking contract state. It's also recommended to avoid logging events inside loops and complex functions.
    - Impact: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 2. Reducing event logging should not affect readability or security. However, it could affect maintainability, as events can be very useful for debugging and tracking contract operations.

3. **Misuse of fallback function:** The fallback function is executed when a contract receives Ether without a data payload. If its implementation is complex, it can consume significant gas and even exceed the block gas limit, causing transactions to fail.

    - Discovery: This pattern is found by comprehending the special nature of the fallback function in Solidity. Its misuse often results from a misunderstanding of its role and how it interacts with Ethereum's gas model.
    - Fix: Keep the fallback function as simple as possible. Avoid state changes or complex computation in this function. If you need to perform more complex operations when Ether is sent, consider using a separate payable function that the sender can call.
    - Impact: Readability: 5; Security: 3; Maintainability: 5. Keeping the fallback function simple should not affect readability or maintainability. However, it may have some impact on security, as it requires careful design to ensure that the contract behaves correctly when it receives Ether.

For future requests, it would be helpful if more specific contexts or use cases were given. It would help in tailoring more real-world, practical patterns. 

Regarding the reasoning process, the key is to understand the nuances of Solidity and the Ethereum gas model. It requires recognizing that certain programming patterns that are efficient in other languages may not be efficient in Solidity due to its unique execution environment. To improve, continually learning about Solidity, Ethereum, and blockchain technology can provide a deeper understanding of gas-efficient programming practices.
