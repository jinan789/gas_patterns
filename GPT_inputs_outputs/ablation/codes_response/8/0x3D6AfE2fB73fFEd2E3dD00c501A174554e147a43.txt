Based on the examples you've provided, here are a few additional gas-wasting patterns that could occur:

1. **Misuse of data types**
    - Discovery Process: Solidity uses different amounts of gas for different data types. This pattern was found by recognizing that developers might use inappropriate data types, which could lead to unnecessary gas usage.
    - Fix: Choose the smallest possible data types that can hold your data. For example, use `uint8` instead of `uint256` if the value being stored will never exceed 255. Also, consider using `bytes1` to `bytes32` instead of `string` for smaller, fixed-size strings.
    - Impact: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4. This fix doesn't impact readability and security but might slightly impact maintainability if developers are not familiar with different data types and their implications.

2. **Excessive use of external function calls**
    - Discovery Process: External function calls, especially those that cross contract boundaries, consume a lot of gas. This pattern was found by considering the overhead of function calls in Solidity.
    - Fix: Where possible, replace external function calls with internal function calls or inline code. However, be cautious not to sacrifice modularity and security in the process.
    - Impact: Readability: 4; Security: 4; Maintainability: 3. This fix might decrease readability and maintainability due to larger code blocks, and could potentially affect security if function encapsulation is lost.

3. **Unoptimized array usage**
    - Discovery Process: Arrays are common in programming, but inefficient use, like unnecessary looping over large arrays, can lead to excessive gas use. This pattern was found by considering typical programming habits and their translation to Solidity.
    - Fix: Try to minimize operations on arrays, especially large ones. If you need to check for existence of an element, consider using a mapping where possible to check in constant time.
    - Impact: Readability: 5; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4. This fix doesn't impact readability and security but might slightly affect maintainability as developers need to be aware of the change from arrays to mappings.

Regarding your prompt, it is quite clear and detailed, which made it easier to understand what you're asking for. However, it could be improved by asking for specific areas of Solidity that you're interested in, such as contract interaction, data storage, or function execution.

In terms of my reasoning process, I tried to draw on my understanding of typical programming practices and how they might translate to Solidity. I also considered the unique characteristics of Solidity, like its gas mechanism and data types. To improve for next time, I could go deeper into specific areas of Solidity, like contract inheritance or event logging. I could also consider more about the trade-offs between gas optimization and other factors like security and maintainability.
