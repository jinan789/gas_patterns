Sure, I'll be glad to assist you with finding new gas-wasting patterns in Solidity. Here are some additional patterns:

**Pattern 1: Overusing global variables**

Global variables in Solidity, especially those stored in the state, are costly in terms of gas. If there's frequent access to these variables, then it can significantly increase the gas cost.

_Reasoning Process_: I found this pattern by considering the cost of storage in Solidity. Since global variables are stored in the state, and accessing the state is expensive, excessive usage of these variables can be a gas-wasting pattern.

_Fix_: Try to minimize the use of global variables. If a variable is only used within a function, make it a local variable. Furthermore, if a global variable is used repeatedly within a function, consider assigning its value to a local variable at the start of the function and use this local variable for further computations.

_Why the Fix Works_: Accessing local variables is cheaper than accessing state variables. By reducing the number of accesses to global variables, we can decrease the gas cost.

_Sacrifices_: Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 3. The code might be slightly less readable due to the increased number of local variables, but it won't affect the security. It might have a medium impact on the maintainability, especially when the function is long and complex.

**Pattern 2: Unoptimized use of arrays**

Arrays in Solidity can be costly, especially dynamic arrays. Using arrays inefficiently, for example adding elements one by one instead of initializing with all elements, can waste gas.

_Reasoning Process_: I found this pattern by considering how arrays work in Solidity. Adding elements to a dynamic array involves the cost of reallocation and copying of the array, which can be expensive.

_Fix_: Try to minimize the use of dynamic arrays. If you need to add multiple elements to an array, consider doing it all at once instead of one by one. 

_Why the Fix Works_: By adding elements all at once, we can avoid the cost of repeatedly reallocating and copying the array, hence saving gas.

_Sacrifices_: Readability: 4; Security: 5; Maintainability: 4. It may slightly impact the readability of the code, but it does not affect security. It might have a small impact on maintainability, especially if the array initialization becomes complex.

**Pattern 3: Frequent use of the `delete` keyword**

Deleting variables in Solidity does not instantly free up memory or storage space, but it does consume gas.

_Reasoning Process_: In Solidity, deleting a variable doesn't immediately free up space, but it still uses gas.

_Fix_: Instead of frequently deleting variables, try reusing them if possible. 

_Why the Fix Works_: By reusing variables, we can avoid the gas cost associated with the `delete` operation.

_Sacrifices_: Readability: 3; Security: 5; Maintainability: 3. This could make the code less readable and slightly more challenging to maintain due to the need to keep track of variable reuse, but it won't affect the security.

**Feedback on the Prompt**

The prompt is pretty clear and provides a good background on gas in Solidity and the need for optimization. One suggestion for improvement is to include more specific examples of the current gas-wasting patterns. This could help provide a better context and make it easier to come up with new patterns.

**Reflection on the Reasoning Process**

The reasoning process focused on understanding the cost associated with different operations in Solidity. By identifying costly operations (like accessing global variables, using arrays, and deleting variables), we can find potential gas-wasting patterns. 

To improve next time, I would delve deeper into the Solidity language and its underlying execution model (EVM). This could help identify more subtle, less-known gas-wasting patterns. Also, I would consider the trade-offs between gas optimization and other aspects like readability, security, and maintainability, as optimizing for gas sometimes might lead to less readable or maintainable code.
